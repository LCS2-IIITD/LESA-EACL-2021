However , I think that the evaluation / decision needs to weigh the impact that inclusion will have on the class as a whole . . . not just whether it ' s good for that one child . . . . because , imo , inclusion to benefit 1 at the expense of others is wrong . 	1
Public school teachers make more money than private school teachers . 	0
I understand & support the desire of parents to have their dcs , regardless of abilities ( high or low ) , in the most beneficial educational environment possible and I know that I made some broad statements / gave examples that obviously doesn ' t apply to every inclusion situation . 	0
I do agree with others who said inclusion does need to be done / evaluated on an individual basis . 	0
ed kid w / the same inclusion student if it feels that doing so is beneficial to the inclusion student without discussing with the parents of the reg . 	0
ed . child whether doing so is desired by them & beneficial for their child . 	0
The fact of the matter is that doing so ( calming down a student ) is not their job or their responsibility . 	0
Some schools , though , such as my dcs ' , will repeatedly place a reg . 	0
Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it ' s just not something popular to speak out about here . 	0
But in general , I don ' t think I could ever be convinced that it ' s " wrong " for me to be anti-homeschool . 	0
The best musicians tend to make the most money . 	0
In addition he adds that single-sex education for boys would allow adequate time for male maturation and would benefit the boys by giving them more structure and discipline due to their tendencies of restlessness and aggression ( Mael , 1998 ) It seems clear that single-sex education advocates have done their research and that it does make sense that girls and boys being separated would foster an environment of non-stereotyping and encourage learning . 	0
Thus my lack of surprise to learn that public school students outperform private school students on a level playing field and that public schools and their teachers are more open to innovations and trying new learning techniques . 	0
On the other hand , it can work in the girls ' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group . 	0
How long until other religions start demanding similar accommodation for their superstitions ? 	0

Forget the obscene fact that Beyonce makes about 200 times what the concertmaster for the New York Philharmonic does , they both do quite well when compared to the average piano teacher who gives lessons through the Jewish Community Center or the YMCA . 	0
You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer . 	0
If schools would agree to this , then why not ? 	0
If we allow Christian students to pray , you must allow Wiccan students to pray , Jewish , Islamic , Muslim . 	0
You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols . 	0
The best accountants tend to make the most money . 	0
Will the Muslim clerics claim the right to punish girls that fail to sit at their rear during their period ? 	0
The best writers — business and entertainment — tend to make the most money . 	0
Isn ' t permitting Muslim prayer in public schools a significant step onto the slippery slope towards applying Sharia Law ? 	0
Now I ’ m not saying that Alex Rodriguez deserves to make more money than Miguel Cabrera , but that they and every other professional ball player make a lot more money than minor leaguers , those in foreign leagues , semi-pros and beer league softballers . 	0
Based on my experience , and my research on competition , gender , and education , promoting all-girls ' education in the grade school years is a useful strategy to raise women who know how to lean in throughout life . 	0
Further in the study Mael highlights both the benefits for females and males to single-sex education he states that because coeducational schools foster obsession over hair and clothes and tend to make girls more silent that the single-sex education of girls is better for their mentality . 	0
Also , if girls schools don ' t have the interest / enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject . 	0
Why should I subsidize others who don ' t make the same degree of personal sacrifice ? 	0
My kids are better educated and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple . 	0
Let me know what you think . 	0
Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars . 	0
Propaganda - not compelling logic . 	0
I find them both rather frightening . 	0
The whole premise of this is flawed . 	0
People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education . 	0
The downturn in quality didn ' t start with people taking their kids out , it had been going on slowly but surely for years . 	0
Lack of discipline , turning teachers into babysitters , banning prayer and the Ten Commandments , and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster . 	0
They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error ( s ) of their ways . 	0
The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it ' s not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child ' s education in order to keep that failing system going . 	1
What a joke ! ! ! 	0
But if prayer really works , then that group of students calling out to God around the flagpole becomes a threat to those who deny the God ’ s existence or His sovereignty over this world . 	0
De La Salle would have mixed results because although single-sex education does have its benefits to boys , there is no clear evidence that exists either way . 	0
Sometimes single sex schools don ' t have the numbers ( or enough interest ) to run certain subjects for example – girls schools may not run shop classes , boys schools may not run home-ec classes . 	0
The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy 	0
It ' s an opinion . 	0
It ' s not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it ' s better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled . 	1
And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward , just that the overall " School " experience to me is very important for development of all children , and to me , that can ' t be entirely replicated at home . 	0
I have reasons behind it . 	0
Yes I do . 	0
Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids , religion , wanting to keep control on kids , special snowflake syndrome , etc ? 	0
Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that ? 	0
I ' m sorry but I do . 	0
Especially not here where there are a lot of highly intelligent people who break the mold IMO for " Every day " mothers in lots of ways . 	0
No way . 	0
Regina high school would benefit the most because their girls would have higher self-esteem and higher self-confidence in their learning abilities then they would at a coeducational school . 	0
I would look at the subjects on offer . 	0
But , from 2007-2010 , JHS was unable to “ initiate this program as designed ” and now plans to revamp the program . 	0
There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been . 	0
So , I guess by the author ' s reasoning , we ' re ALL " good " people . 	0
Good parents do what is best for their children , and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend . 	0
It went great as far as academics and learning . 	0
I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling . 	0
It wasn ' t that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn ' t help , it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who , even obvious to a 7th grader , HATED their jobs . 	0
Then , I was switched to public schooling in a " better " district , and my grades went from A ' s to D ' s . 	0
I know it sounds wrong , but that ' s the way it is . . . 	0
5 ) Religion is a touchy issue . 	0
A 2010 study on two separate pre-school classes displays negative , social affects on students , " In one class , the teacher used gender-specific language to address the children . 	0
The other teacher did not . 	0
It is clear to me that the issue of single-sex education juggles an academic as well as a psychological / social side . 	0
A article published by ABC News focuses on the negative effects of single-sex education when it comes to the social aspect . 	0
But does that single-sex environment only further the intelligence of the " elite " students in private education ? 	0
Again , Penn State ' s Lynn Liben denies any benefits of single-sex schooling , " Kids ' own occupational aspirations are going to be limited , and there could be long-term consequences where , for example , girls are used to being in roles only among other girls , then they have to face the real world where that ' s not the case . " 	0
Another factor in this issue is that most single-sex schools are private , and require an entrance test . 	0
Therefore , one can argue that the students in single-sex schools are already at an advantage . 	0
Studies show that women suffer from a stereotype threat in math and science , meaning that in the fields of math and science women are more apprehensive to perform due to their perceived inferiority to men . 	0
Perhaps that is why girls at my high school were so confident in their work , there were no boys to do better and perhaps this is why women are always found to do better in single-sex school environments . 	0
Even Jesus was against school prayer . 	0
Matt 6 : 5-6 Anyways , children can pray in school if they want to . 	0
Japan , where no one prays at school , has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation . 	0
I mean , c ’ mon ! 	0
How pathetic . 	0
Are we so weak minded ? 	0
Wow , here we go again . 	0
Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school . 	0
At the end of the day , we are not preparing our students for the real world . 	0
That right hasn ’ t been taken away , they merely need to keep it to themselves . 	0
It just isn ’ t fair to have prayer required in schools . 	1
Many schools are choosing to spend those limited resources on single-sex programs despite the fact that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism . ” 	0
The Socialist agenda of world domination makes no place for solemn “ swearing ” between individuals . 	0
As a result of prioritizing single-sex classes , these schools don ’ t have the funds to spend on techniques that have actually been proven to improve academic outcomes , like smaller class sizes and personalized learning environments with mentors , counseling , and other supports . 	0
Private schools usually offer smaller classrooms , and generally provide better facilities for students . 	0
What ’ s next ? 	0
Today , parents and students can choose a variety of ways to homeschool . 	0
There are co-ops that offer classes to all levels from pre-k to high school . 	0
Some offer these classes throughout the week and you can choose which classes to take . 	0
Others offer classes once a week and parents teach . 	0
In fact , I didn ' t really grasp geometry till I started gardening . 	0
Today ' s homeschoolers can learn Russian or even geometry without their parent ' s assistance through DVDs and online courses . 	0
Homeschool has morphed into a uniquely American creation . 	0
We should all be proud of what it has become no matter where we stand on the homeschool versus public school debate . 	0
Then there is the mix of private school and homeschool , where the student is taught in a classroom three days a week and the parent downloads assignments from the same teacher the other two days a week . 	0
You can participate in any sport or any extracurricular function via these co-ops that you can in public school . 	0
I think mainstream is not that much good for our kids . 	1
There must be some changes for getting out their best from them . 	0
I ' m a regular education teacher . 	0
I have students mainstreamed into my class every year . 	0
My opinion is that it needs to be done far more judiciously than it is done now- if six exceptional children are put in my class , that is the equivalent of putting an entire special ed classroom into my regular class . 	0
I personally feel like these kids are shortchanged- some of them are good kids who need an adult close by and able to give more focused attention . 	0
In a class of 30+ , this isn ' t going to happen consistently . 	0
And some of the ones who come to me have legally imposed modifications , some of which have little or no bearing on what I teach , so I am not allowed to handle my class in a way I think it should be done . 	0
That impairs my efficiency as an educator . 	0
Also , some have so many modifications that for all intents and purposes they are merely taking a special ed class whose physical location just happens to be in a regular classroom . 	0
From my point of view , mainstreaming is not a terrible idea , but it is lamentable in its execution , and because of that , damaging in its results . 	1
Dr . Densmore encourages parents to keep themselves on an even keel and project a steady , positive attitude . 	0
Lib mentality on crack ! 	0
Extreme behavioral trouble , kids that just aren ' t able to keep up with what they ' re learning in average classes , etc . But on the whole , I like mainstreaming . 	1
Besides forbidding perjury , ( calling God to witness a lie ) and false swearing , this passage also forbids all rash and unnecessary swearing , and especially warns against promissory oaths – that require a performance . 	0
Public schools receive money from federal and state governments and are obligated to do whatever the state and national governments say . 	0
I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart . 	0
It is a juggling act for teachers in inclusive classrooms to handle the needs of so many different students but it is well worth the reward . 	1
He also notes in the article the classroom ' s reaction to Jonas ' demeanor ( slow to articulate his words , delay in making his meaning understanding ) and how there is a clearly defined moment where the classroom establishes that Jonas is " different " . 	0
The professor realizes in that instance that this is a moment for himself and the classroom to accept and engage Jonas and somehow help him navigate his way throughout the course and the classroom . 	0
Forced prayer isn ’ t prayer anyway . 	0
When prayer was removed from the schools I think that it worked to the Christians advantage , not against them . 	0
I have a feeling that all we Christians are asking for when they want prayer back into the schools is for some sort of superior respect above all other religions in allowing us to have our sacred prayers brought into the schools . 	0
How many of us would stand for that kind of equality ? 	0
Jesus said to expect persecution , suffering , being servants of all and to be in the face of regular culture standards . 	0
Why would Christians demand or even expect that their way of doing things should be allowed and even made a routine ? 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to act in a Christian manner . 	0
He did not say to get upset when the government goes the opposite way of what is comfortable to us and try to make our systems fit our religious needs the best . 	0
If prayer being in the schools or not seriously affects the outcome of our students , or affects anything at all in the Christian world negatively than I think we have a lot more serious problems to think about than whether or not the kids are allowed to pray or not in school . 	0
It makes no sense to expect a public school to bring prayer back , if that ’ s what we want , we should send our kids to a Christian school . 	0
We not only have a strong parental relationship but the siblings do as well . 	0
This alone is a wonderful opportunity for building social skills . 	0
The usual argument for private schools is that they have the freedom to offer any curriculum that they choose , and the freedom to hire or fire teachers who can teach effectively . 	0
He notes that student bodies are increasingly riddled with drugs , violence , promiscuity , emotional disorders , crime , illiteracy , peer dependency and contempt for authority . 	0
It is disturbing to read the 101 reasons to homeschool . 	0
How is that for socialization ? 	0
One reason we choose to homeschool is because our family wanted to maintain family relationships in a way that cannot be done if our children are in school six-plus hours a day . 	0
Life is short and we want to spend the majority of our time together . 	0
Children grow up quickly and before you know it , they are heading off on their own . 	0
Of course this is not the only reason to homeschool but since we are interacting with each other all day long , it forces us to deal with relationship issues when they come up . 	0
We enjoy being around our children and they enjoy being around us . 	0
There is no longer an absolute and just legal basis for judging “ between a man and his brother , ” much less a man and his neighbor ( Deuteronomy 1 : 16 , 17 ) . 	0
Fortunately , my parents saw what was happening and moved me to a private school where I was challenged at or above the grade level I was in at the time . 	0
( I am certainly not the first to ask this question . ) 	0
Leonard Sax , a psychologist and physician , argues not only that gender segregated schools can be equal , but that they can be better than coeducational schooling . 	1
The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all . 	0
Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different ? 	0
According to the ACLU , not only are sex-segregated educational programs ineffective , they are illegal . 	1
Title IX , which states that “ No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance … ” , is where the ACLU and other opponents of sex-segregated schools point to bolster their claim of illegality . 	0
He argues that the language of “ separate but equal ” in relation to the single-sex education debate is out of place because while racial segregation of schooling was about limiting students ’ access , single-sex education is about broadening students ’ access and opportunities . 	0
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) disagrees . 	0
The ACLU has struggled against sex-segregated schooling for a very long time , but earlier this year they officially launched their “ Teach Kids , Not Stereotypes ” campaign . 	0
As a part of the campaign , they gathered data on single-sex education programs in 15 states and found that the majority of them were out of compliance with Title IX requirements . 	0
If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I ' d be saving money ( not the school ) - but I ' d be not doing the best I can for my kids . 	0
My daughter will be 5 in Sept . and she is going to Kindergarten . 	0
She is very excited to go and I don ’ t want her to be behind . 	0
She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc ’ s but not all of them . 	0
She is small for age , but so was I . I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad . 	0
I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability , but I learned to cope . 	0
I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school . 	0
All affairs of life become subject to state , rather than individual control . 	0
That is the only thing that kept me from being a delinquent . 	0
I would argue that integration is an aspiration and not a prerequisite for ensuring the best education for disabled children . 	0
This has the effect of treating all students the same and teaching them the same things , despite the fact that every student is unique , and not all students fit into the same categories . 	0
Just look at the students of the Kings School you see traveling to school I went to the Lorien novalis school fete at dural on Saturday amazed at the Muslim mothers there but then I thought this school gives them the chance to partipate in their children ' s education far more than the local state school so as a community private education is far better around than state education can be 	1
Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking . 	0
A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren ’ t allowed to pray in school anymore . 	0
You can customize the syllabus for your child according to his needs and abilities . 	0
There is a lot of heated rhetoric in the air these days regarding an alleged ban on prayer in the public schools . 	0
Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as " Christian " , but if most of those are not religious and don ' t believe in God , that ' s a pretty nominal affiliation . 	0
My reading of it is now lots of grandparents are awarding scholarships to their grandchildren and a good private school allows the grandparents access to the children ' s education by the out of hours activities that these schools offer against the public system . . 	0
Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as " religious " . 	0
Rev . Ingram documents and points out that “ a broad , organized attack reaching into high places is under way to remove the third commandment from legal standing in the United States and throughout the world . ” 	0
In recent blogs , I ’ ve been concerned with clearing up some common misconceptions relating to areas of interface ( sometimes involving significant controversy and conflict ) between religion and secular American culture . 	0
It ' s in danger of becoming one of those joke laws , like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester , and needs to be removed . 	0
If a private school is not teaching its students well enough , its graduation rate , or its college acceptance rate , will sink , and parents will be able to quickly remove their child and put him or her into a better school . 	0
E and did some kind of activity . 	0
Now days they do not do as much activity at school or at home . 	0
When I was in grade school we had Recess in the morning , then lunch at noon and after we ate we were taken out side and walked around the baseball field . 	0
Then we had P . 	0
Now the government is talking about kids being obese so we have to have health food . 	0
Its not so much what they eat as much as what they do ! 	0
Well the Federal Government got involved and that is what has ruined schools . 	0
Also school has dumbed down since I went . 	0
I would say to myself in frustration . 	0
“ This isn ’ t how the world is ! ” 	0
I had to get out , for the sake of my future ! 	0
For four long years , grades six through nine , I attended a rigid , traditional all-girls school . 	0
In 2013 , is single-sex education really the way to go ? 	1
Much more my style . 	0
Now days kids want to sit and play xbox , Nintendo , computers , ipads , or ipods or ride four wheelers when they should be out playing or riding bicycles . 	0
I part yea parents need to take an active role in their child ' s health and education , but if the school fails to sucks then let them put them in private school . 	0
The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class . 	0
Is we choose to send our children to a different , more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education , So be it . 	0
@eileenphoto . 	0
School can be very bad for you . 	1
For some people it can be a catastophic experience from which they never recover . 	0
To claim otherwise is rank ignorance . 	0
Being an involved parent with kids in public schools , it doesn ' t matter what policies I try to bring about , or suggestions I bring , or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of , things will NOT change . 	0
I just wanted to present a much more common iteration . 	0
The racialized question of separate but equal in education was answered by Brown v . 	0
It is heartbreaking . 	0
Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class ? 	0
tara_mommy : I agree with you too , which is why I said : There are obviously cases where this isn ' t going to work . 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
It would require that they make certain that their children are given opportunities to interact with and form lasting relationships with other children in their age group , and this is can achieved by exposing them to extracurricular activities . 	0
I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education . 	0
Our “ Yes ” should be “ Yes , ” and our “ No ” should mean “ No . ” 	0
She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic . 	0
The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math . 	0

My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8 . 	1
My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school . 	0
I was ahead of my peers by high school . 	0
Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively . 	0
My kids attend public school now and I detest it . 	0
In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn ' t assign homework because the kids didn ' t do it anyway . . . WHAT ? 	0
They can ' t bring home their books , so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they ' ve learned in school . 	0
I also don ' t agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things . 	0
So reward the bad behavior ? ? 	0
If understood , our word uttered in integrity should of itself be a sufficient and proper bond . 	0
It is , and always has been pure ignorance , stop slating something you have no experience or knowledge about . 	0
If it is a public school it should be a place where all cultures and all religions and all people should be able to come and feel comfortable in order to do what they are there to do which I ’ m sorry is not to learn about religion . 	0
If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school . 	0
Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job . 	0
I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through , NO ONE ( at 19 mind you ) . 	0
In conclusion , I personally believe that forcing prayer upon our children in the class room is wrong . 	1
Ok if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot . 	0
I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn ’ t do what your father told you , you were going to get the belt , and you know what you sure never made that mistake again . 	0
In today ’ s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility . 	0
People today are basically in my mind , for a lack of a better word soft . 	0
Now , you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him / her and your own child can sue you . 	0
This was different . 	0
This was saying we believe in coeducation , because we live in a coed world , but in this one particular area we ’ re giving up . 	0
Those schools weren ’ t founded on the premise that men and women have incompatible intellects , but in recognition of what were often limited educational opportunities for women . 	0
Their origin stories belonged to the past , and their traditions continued , Hogwarts-like , under their own steam . 	0
Everything I could think of saying sounded offensive or deflating or dumb : math is hard for girls ; they—that is , you—need special treatment ; boys ’ and girls ’ brains are different ; pre-algebra with boys in the room is just too exciting—you won ’ t know what hit you ! 	0
If we ’ d chosen an all-girls ’ school , that would be one thing . 	0
I ’ d never found the arguments especially persuasive . 	0
But what really brought me up short was imagining how I would explain the policy to my daughter , whose best friends were boys . 	0
A few years ago , when I was looking at middle schools for my daughter , I heard about a school that sounded lovely except for one thing : it had a policy of separating math classes by gender . 	0
Having reported on a vogue for single-sex classrooms in the nineties , I knew the rationale : girls and boys distract one another ; girls need extra ego boosts and a gentle approach when it comes to studying math and science . 	0
The public schools are not going to get better . 	1
no . teachers keep asking for more with no difference in teaching just more money and if they dont get it what happens they strike . well thats real nice on kids education is it not boo hoo you TAKE YOUR KIDS PRIVATE IF YOU CARE AS I DID 	1
BIG E . what about all the money we do send to our schools . does it help our child . 	0
Now , we are talking about a school-sponsored prayer . 	0
No student-sponsored prayer is , or needs to be , prohibited . 	0
But in the Cold War , America was distinguishing itself from a Communist enemy that was known to be atheistic . 	0
So , the school district in New York decided to develop a prayer which they thought anyone who believed in God could pray . 	0
But you have to look at the background on this . 	0
Our country was initially populated by people escaping religious persecution who were looking for a safe have to practice their own religion . 	0
When we came together as a country , we had a religiously diverse population , so when we wrote the constitution , we had to say that the government would not support any religion at the expense of others , nor would it prohibit the free exercise of religion . 	0
Prayer in public schools was a complicated issue where there was a religious diversity amongst students and teachers , because , how could , say , Catholics and Protestants agree on a prayer to say . 	0
( Those of you who pray , do you ever pray generic prayers ? ) 	0
I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving . 	1
We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life . 	0
So I say Allison Benedikt , treat the cause not the system . 	0
The major thing was that I always felt like the presence of boys would have made the girls far less bitchy ( as they did in my co-ed school experiences ) . 	0
My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb . 	0
We pay very high taxes , most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions not how they derive at them . 	0
As such there is pressure on the schools to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place . 	0
Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems . 	0
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) of 1990 requires all schools to provide services for children who need special education in the “ least restrictive environment conducive to learning . ” 	0
And in that aspect , he ' s correct : According to Virginia law , parents who have a religious objection can opt to not only home-school their children but to do so without any government oversight , meaning there is no mandatory curriculum and no checks placed on the family to ensure the children are learning at an appropriate level . 	0
It was previously mentioned in this project that coeducational schools need to adopt a non-stereotyping language and equal opportunity environment to foster equity and success between boys and girls . 	0

I am a product and proponent of the public school system , and do my best to support to support local public schools ( especially when it comes to music and arts programs ) whenever possible . 	0
I also send my son to a local private elementary school . 	0
More to the point , US public schools are the best in the world . 	1
So , no special education , no behavior problems , and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education . 	0
If students fail the high-stakes test in America , schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade , again , because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability . 	0
They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability , income , behavior , etc . . . Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level , that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for " career " training at their " ability level . " 	0
The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria . 	0
It is absolutely correct . 	0
Public schools have neither option . 	0
They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies . 	0
We were taught tolerance and acceptance . 	0
Clearly we ’ re off to a great start . 	0
With private schools stealing students away from public schools , the problem is exacerbated further . 	0
This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally , whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level . 	0
Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he ' s loving it . 	0
This could lead to costly court battles , or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs . 	0
What if the child ' s parents dissent ? 	0
Although I accept that initial intentions can be noble , sometimes , the language of liberation can carry an unintended payload . 	0
If you don ' t do well , it isn ' t necessarily the school ' s fault . 	0
Public school is what you and your parents make of it . 	1
Everyone I know went to public school and on to college . 	0
It really is up to the student to do the work . 	0
Maybe schools were better then . 	0
We didn ' t feel unprepared . 	0
I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them . 	0
And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to , even better , homeschool , are not going to make a difference . 	0
Social advancement ? 	0
Human nature makes the final result , of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment , stagnation for the simple lack of incentive . 	0
Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools , government and anything else unions monopolize . 	0
It ' s human nature . 	0
The problem is without competition , the product becomes stale and innovation disappears . 	0
Unions DO NOT like competition ( try walking across a strike line , you SCAB ) . 	0
For years they nearly had one , the result , the sad shape of our public school system . 	0
Public schools want a monopoly . 	0
Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET ' s like every other property owner . 	0
Whether the result is choosing a state school , independent school or home education will depend on our children , our selves and our family situations . 	0
If we don ' t make decisions based on our ideas and beliefs , our moral values and our understanding of the world - then surely we are failing to do our best for our children . 	0
To say school is best is every bit as ideological as any argument for home education . 	0
But then everyone is . 	0
But they are guided by their own values , beliefs and yes - ideology . 	0
Others come to it later because school has not worked for their child . 	0
Some choose it at the start because their child appears to be unsuited to early formal education , or because they favour education methods not available in state schools . 	0
Home educators come from many backgrounds , with many different beliefs and use many different educational methods - from the very structured , adult-led to the informal , child-led . 	0
Public schools are fad driven . 	0
Remember new math ? 	0
For example , consider the theories that " boys are visual learners " and " girls are auditory learners . " 	0
Their research suggests that learning is best accomplished when the delivery method matches the subject matter . 	0
According to researchers Dr . Rebecca Bigler and Dr . Lise Eliot , " Placing children into classrooms based on their gender and making assumptions about their physiology , brains , interests , and learning ability will virtually guarantee that teachers ' expectations are biased and their gender-based practices are misguided for most of their students . " 	0
Bigler and Eliot maintain that many of the popular ideas about gender learning are simply untrue . 	0
Still , critics of single-sex education contend that the vast majority of research is based on pseudoscience " laughable to neuroscientists . " 	0
The differences that have been identified are considered too small to warrant separating students . 	0
While co-ed schools can reinforce stereotypes , girls and boys can be free to pursue math , science , poetry , or art , without gender role pressure in single-sex environments . 	0
A mother of a single-sex educated girl remarked , " I feel that the single gender environment has given her a level of confidence and informed interest in math and science that she may not have had otherwise . " 	0

He ' s not very big and he ' s right in the middle of his class with school work . 	0
Any advantage he may have had in sports vanished as soon as the rest of the football team learned their right from their left . 	0
There ' s a real possibility that he would have been diagnosed with a disorder when his real problem was lack of maturity . 	0
It would have been a horrible struggle for him to start at age 5 , and he would have been held back anyway . 	0
I try not to be anti-homeschooling , but . . . it ' s just hard for me . 	1
I really haven ' t met any homeschoolers who turned out quite right , including myself . 	0
I apologize if what I ' m saying offends any of you - that ' s not my intention , I know that there are many homeschooled children who do just fine , but that hasn ' t been my experience . 	0
I have a friend who is 16 , the same age as me . 	0
She has never watched a PG-13 movie . 	0
She has never been on the internet . 	0
She only reads books that her parents pick out for her . 	0
She is not allowed to go outside by herself . 	0
She is not allowed to listen to non-religious music . 	0
She has no idea how people get pregnant . 	0
That means adults engaging with children during play to help them develop negotiation skills or to share complex ideas . 	0
One way parents can help prepare their children is to ensure that there is adequate facilitated play in preschool . 	0
Gone are the days when kindergarten teachers hold up a letter and ask the class to name it . 	0
This isn ’ t your mother ’ s kindergarten ! 	0
What ’ s a parent to do ? 	0
Today , kindergarten is drawing , writing , literacy , reading , and science and math and all those subjects that kids didn ’ t used to get until first or second grade . ” 	0
Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same . 	0
I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school ( one that I had done a lot of background checking into first ) . 	0
Not saying that private schools don ' t have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have . 	0
There ' s no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today ' s times . 	1
The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways . 	0
There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down . 	0
The neighboring county public schools are the same . 	0
The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive . 	0
Home learners ranked in the 84th percentile , compared to publicly schooled students , who were drastically lower in the 23rd . 	0

Dr . Thomas Smedley believes that homeschoolers have superior socialization skills , and his research supports this claim . 	0
So how do these different settings affect children ? 	0
Isn ’ t this where real community interaction and contacts are made ? 	0

When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing . 	0
Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school . some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools . 	0
The mass socialization within schools has brought about abundant delinquent behavior within our nation ’ s youth , reports education researcher , Dr . Michael Slavinski . 	0
What about negative socialization ? 	0
Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church . 	0
I ' m proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon ! 	1
Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight , like quality education , not quantity education , and not buying unneeded items like bleachers , I ' ll consider sending my kids . . . . wait , nevermind ! 	0
No I won ' t ! 	0
When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner , then that is where one of the problems lies . 	0
What a stupid argument ! 	0
We are all so glib in the way we promise and don ’ t perform and never realize that it is sapping our moral energy . “ Think then , what happens to a nation rife with perjury , broken marriage covenants , unforgiveness , cults with demonic covenants , extortion , bribery , libel , slander , profanity , hypocrisy , idle talk , and lawsuits initiated solely for revenge and personal gain . 	0
And there ’ s the real trouble with this single-sex approach . 	0
Home educators on the other hand can use all these methods as and when appropriate . 	0
Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy , some of had to sacrifice to do it , but it was definitely worth every penny . 	0
I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London . 	0
The presumptions behind it are fusty and often plain silly—which might make them easy for kids who don ’ t conform to them to dismiss , except that their teachers and principals are repeating them so earnestly . 	0
I ' m sure that if we did away with private schools the government would then fix all the problems wiht public education . 	0
Liberal lean with putting the blame on people that wish to provide a better education for their children . 	0
Friggin idiots . 	0

Now segregation by gender is more often an intervention for boys—a switch in target that makes you wonder a little about the reliability of the justifications for the policy . 	0

“ The goal was to address the struggles boys were having with reading , ” the A . P . story explains of the effort in an Idaho school . 	0
Well last night I caught 60 Minutes ' rebroadcast of Redshirting - Holding kids back from kindergarten , which I had missed back in March , and I was , once again , all in a huff . 	0
This piece of journalism , as have many others ( in both print & broadcast ) focused solely on the superficial and relatively transient perceived benefits of holding your 5-year-old back , while Mr . Safer & team failed to explore any of the real developmental reasons some children really do need to put off kindergarten for a year and how that extra time may benefit them in the short and long term . 	0
( Remember my rant last fall - Redshirting . 	0
. 	0
. 	0
What about tomorrow ? ) 	0
I ' ve said it before , and I ' ll say it again . 	0
. 	0
. 	0
Redshirting your 5-year-old solely for the purpose of giving them an advantage in sports , a leg up in the future popularity contest , or just to save them from the horrible fate of being the " youngest " in their class ( and the last to have a driver ' s license ) drives me NUTZ ! 	0
FFRF admonishes that the event is an “ ostentatious display of piety at school . ” 	0
All this and more happened to me . 	0
Or leave it to the teacher ( me ) to pick the kid up from a supermarket for shoplifting and sort it out , because they are watching the football . 	0
I tended to teach the kids in my class as individuals . 	0
I would also like to add that I personally , in many years in a very mixed comprehensive in Inner London , never took the blindest bit of notice of who was currently " failing " as a group , whether it be black , Asian , white boys , girls or bunny rabbits . 	0
At school , or homeschooled . 	0
The kids that do well and attain up to their optimum levels are the ones with good parental support . 	0
You really can ' t expect a child to listen to a teacher telling them they can succeed , when their parents can ' t be bothered to pick them up after a football match , or send them to school dirty , unwashed . 	0
Sadly , many parents seemed to regard school as a babysitter , not something to be worked with , and were all to ready to blame the teachers or school rather then themselves or the child . 	0
If a teacher can call the parent and get backed up , and work with the parent , then the kid will do well and work through difficulties . 	0
The one factor that I did notice made the biggest difference was , as mentioned above , parenting . 	0
My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors , yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium . 	0
One high school where I taught had almost 2 , 000 students ; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal ' s office . 	0
Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools . 	0
Neighborhood schools were community gathering places , where parents , kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other . 	0
Run , don ' t walk , to the nearest private school . 	1
Public schools are not about education ; they are about social engineering . 	0
I taught in public high schools for 15 years . 	0
My advice to parents ? 	0
It is time we stop rewarding a bad system , and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition . 	0
The school board for my system was made up of lay people , each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education . 	0
In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools . 	0
I believe a more disciplined school in the formative teenage years pays off when the child matures . 	0
I know my friend ' s case is rather extreme , but the thing is . . . the vast majority of my homeschooled friends have similar issues . 	0
Many of them are also very over-protected by their parents , and many of them , to be honest , act more like 6th-graders than 10th-graders . 	0
Jewelry ? 	0
Purse ? 	0
We had a Regina George , Gretchen Wieners , Karen Smith and , of course , a Cady Heron . 	0
Really , it was like Mean Girls ! 	0
Who makes your sneakers ? 	0
Just because we had a strict uniform , by no means did that mean there wasn ’ t competition wardrobe-wise . 	0
I was sent on a wild goose chase from clique to clique . 	0
I actually had to go down there one day , find the culprit and set the record straight . 	0
There was to be no cross-contamination between groups ; you had to choose your friends or the queen bees would choose for you . 	0
When I eventually found her , she gave me a snobby and unapologetic , “ Sorry , are we done here ? ” , swiveled on her pink Converse and strutted in the opposite direction . 	0
Not everything in the media is okay . 	0
Being outdoors by yourself can be dangerous . 	0
She acts younger than her age , and I often find that in order to get along with her , I have to act less mature as well . 	0
Now , I understand her parents ' point of view . 	0
But if you ' re going to survive in it , you have to know what you ' re up against . 	0
I can tell you without a doubt that when my friend reaches adulthood and leaves home , she will be stepping into a world that she knows nothing about , and she ' s going to suffer because of it . 	0
Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT ! ! ! 	1
I was even a public school high school teacher ! 	0
I trust that was tongue in cheek ? 	0
And , until America starts realizing that education is a privilege that should be supported and respected , where teachers are revered , we are always going to have problems . 	0
But she ' s not a child anymore , she ' s going to legally be an adult in two years , and she does not understand the world at all . 	0
So yes , if you want a strong , no bull , parent supported , child first , customer service-based , " you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out " educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded , then you should send your child to a private school . 	0
And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and " live to serve the public " and don ' t want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding , they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators . 	0
Yeah , the world is a pretty suckish place , and I can completely understand why any parent would want to shield their child from it . 	0
I can not believe that someone in the room did not beotch slap her for suggesting such lunacy . 	0
There is no more public education , it is all indoctrination , warm and fuzzy political correctness . 	0
She is a total marxist moron . 	0
They have something to lose if they act a fool . 	0
YOU ARE IDIOTS . 	0
I apologize , but your child may be playing violent video games and what not , but when they go out and rape or shoot someone . 	0
Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they ’ re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong . 	0
O ’ and side note all those parents that think that “ Angry Music & Video Games ” are the root of all evil and its what ’ s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society . 	0
SOCIETY SIDE NOTE : The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God . 	0
It is because of what our society has become . 	0
It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting , maybe you should have hit them those last few times . 	0
And if any of you are saying “ Well what about the belt ? ” there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists . 	0
All parents carefully consider their child ' s education and those decisions are not taken lightly . 	0
The parents think of school as a free baby sitter . 	0
People who send their children to a private school are not “ bad ” people . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
They want the best for their kids ! 	0
I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids . 	0
I think the individual schools themselves and and the individual needs of your daughters are more important than generalisations about education and single-sex or co-ed schools . 	0
However , if you want an opinon from a general education pespective , and you can read up on this , the general rule is that single sex schools are better for the academic performance of your daughters . 	1
Research is quite clear about this . 	0
The children in the private system , are polite , listen to what you are telling them and responsive . 	0
For the benefit of chidlren of course . 	0
I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved . 	1
It is wasting valuable school time . 	0
I have had parents tell me , I gave birth , my job is over , it is your ( mine , the teachers , ect ) to raise and educate these kids . 	0
It stems from children having kids , forcing them off on the grandparents , and the children thinking that they mother is there sister . 	0
One of the benefits of SEN education arguably benefits all children ; class sizes are smaller ensuring a better teacher to pupil ratio . 	0
How prevalent is redshirting anyway ? 	0
*How many homeschooling families do you know ? * I cited three as specific examples , so you ' re way off already . 	0
*None of them cite a desire to avoid diversity as a reason to homeschool . * There are numerous studies on why people homeschool , and a significant portion of the reasons boil down to " wanted to avoid having my children subjected to opinions , values , beliefs , etc . , that I don ' t agree with .

Do you have any advice on how to start to get people together and have the law changed and to allow school prayer back so it will be constitutional ? 	0
I will like to start prayer in the schools of Moses Lake , Wa . 	1
You can pray whenever you want . 	0
Do not be like them , for your Father knows what you need before you ask him . ” 	0
I always thought of girls as the sports stars and the valedictorians , because at my school they were . 	0
But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . 	0
I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . 	0
And when you pray , do not keep on babbling like pagans , for they think they will be heard because of their many words . 	0
Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . 	0
This entire article is ridiculous . 	0
Who are you all to say that we need God in our lives . 	0
You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in : Matthew 6 : 5-8 “ And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . 	0
You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn ’ t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children . 	0
All the enrichment camps and afterschool activities will not make up for the fact that your kid is bored for 6-8 hours per day in school and whips through their homework in a flash , or takes all night because they are so bored they can ' t stand it . 	0
I believe that parents should send their kids to the school the best fits the needs of the child at the time . 	0
Yes , parents can provide support and should , but when your child is bored at school , there is only so much you can do to help with that . 	0
Occasionally , you will get lucky and have a teacher that will challenge your kid in class , but if not , then what ? 	0
And it is the cornerstone of a child ’ s well-being , ” Densmore told me . 	0
The National Association for the Education of Young Children offers lots of information about the benefits of play and how parents and teachers can help facilitate it . 	0
Prayer should be back in school to give these kids that are going up a sense of belief , trust and fear of God , because kids these days think they could do anything they want to and get away with it . 	1
On the community level , Densmore encourages parents to take an active role . 	0
Parents should talk with teachers , principals , and other parents . 	0
Look for preschools with facilitated play as the center of their curriculum . 	0
I have only one more problem . 	0
Where would we find enough time for an actual school day ? 	0
This is where the difference is . 	0
Teaching things that contradicting any belief , or lack of belief , is one thing . 	0
Teaching " God " and then praying to that deity is something else , and just as problematic as teaching " no God " then insisting all recite " There is no God " at some point in the school day over and over . 	0
Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too , and also showing similar respect to any other deity ( ies ) any of them might possibly believe in , or their family does . 	0
If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah , Zoroaster , Zeus and the Gods ? 	0
The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools . 	0
They cannot correct errors , cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students , assign homework , or expect respect from the students . 	0
No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth , he was no God , as I ' m sure all would say . 	0
No matter when your child starts kindergarten , it ’ s a new beginning for him or her—and for you . 	0
Additionally , many homeschooling families belong to like-minded groups that meet regularly and participate in field trips . 	0
The more people leave , the worse its going to become . 	0
Pray on your own time . 	0
They do not belong . 	0
Offend everybody equally ! ! 	0
No prayers in schools ! 	1
And if the answer to that is " Maybe , but those children are still alive " , then consider this : an estimated 16 children per year commit suicide because of problems at school . 	0
Even the language of the serious case review demonstrates this failure of understanding . 	0
Small wonder that home-educating parents are afraid of conferring power on people who do not know what it is that they are judging . 	0
This is particularly so for families who have taken children out of school ; they would be in the insidious position of being answerable to a system that they believe has already failed them . 	0
The idea that you can protect children simply by increasing government involvement ignores the difficulties the education system itself imposes on the lives of many families . 	0
Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible . 	0
My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school . 	0
When we moved to an areas with better schools , we would go to public schools or magnet schools . 	0
We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible . 	0
Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well . 	1
We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life . 	0
Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools . 	0
Why ? 	0
My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools . 	0
When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests . 	0
He made this children take the Vineyard Adaptive Behavior Scales test , which identifies well-adapted behaviors and maturity . 	0
Why don ' t students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them ( e . g . Muslims go to Muslim schools , Christians to Christian schools , Jewish to Jewish schools etc . ) , and for all other students , no religious doctrine in the schools , period . 	1
Here ' s a suggestion : why don ' t we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language . 	0
I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian , because it makes students of other faiths ' uncomfortable , yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed . 	0
If my memory serves me correctly , there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord ' s Prayer in schools , yet this special status has been given to Muslim students , in this case . 	0
If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions , such as Wicca , Shinto , Satanism , Kabbalah , Bahai ' i , etc . And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice ' s beliefs . 	0
Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group ? 	0
When does it end ? 	0
We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else . 	0

My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child I agree too , that although labels are scary for Parents , with them , the Children do get more benefits and support , so can be a positive thing Fran 	0
These beliefs on the effects of homeschooling on socialization have led to numerous studies on homeschooled kids . 	0
Rather than prove these beliefs to be correct , they show a very clear picture that homeschooled children and teens present a distinct advantage over their peers in public school . 	0
Because of the growing incidences of peer pressure and bullying , violence , drugs , promiscuity and moral relativism , the greater is the belief of parents that they need to take their kids out of public school before these influences have a detrimental effect on both their lives and their future . 	0
It is ironic to say the least that in Dr . Brian Ray ’ s California study , around 92 percent of public school superintendents harbors the erroneous notions that homeschooled kids are socially impaired , emotionally unstable , and “ too judgmental ” of their community and the world in general . 	0
President Theodore Roosevelt once said , “ To educate a man in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society . ” 	0
This is an ideal that is being espoused by homeschooling parents who no longer wish to expose their children to the questionable teachings and people that are a part of the public school system . 	0
Teachers , on the other hand , are afraid that they will lose their jobs to more effective parents who are not even certified educators . 	0
It is not surprising , therefore , that they would constantly put down homeschooling as not an effective form of education , specifically targeting the “ lack of social skills ” as a main point against homeschoolers . 	0
What she will get is brainwashed to be a liberal zombie and grow up to write and believe stupid articles like this one . 	0
What a load of BS . 	0
All I can say is WOW ! ! ! 	0
That ' s right , I do not give a s**t about the public schools system , I care about giving my child the best education and best opportunities possible and she will NOT get that at a public school . 	0
I never post on these things but today I had to . 	0
However it may take a little while to really settle down to an “ absence of a rigid routine ” before you can enjoy this freedom from timetables and rules of an educational institution . 	0
Greater Freedom “ The morning rush to catch the school bus … it all seems to belong to some distant world now , ” smiles Mariam , who has been homeschooling her only child for the past two years . 	0
I don ’ t know if any school can nourish her love for science as much as my husband and I do . ” 	0
She is my one and only and I want to go all out to nurture her interest . 	0
She simply loves doing what we do . 	0
We do science experiments , go on nature walks , explore the environment around us and create our own worksheets . 	0

“ I find the homeschooling system very supportive of the child and his needs ” says Mariam , mother of a seven year old only child . 	0
( check if your state has any restrictive legal requirement in connection with this ) . 	0
I ’ m thinking / planning on submitting this to the local Sarnia newspaper in repsonse to all the poorly written letters lobbying for prayer to be brought back into the schools . 	0
Additionally , it is said that homeschooled children do well on standardised tests , and as adults , are known to be self-directed learners and reliable employees . 	0
On the other hand , as a family member recently pointed out to me , by homeschooling children we could be stunting the development of their socialisation skills . 	0
I make that point because teachers specialise in specific subject areas and if parents choose to homeschool their children , it is expected that they would have vast knowledge of each subject area which they choose to teach their children . 	0
Research in the United States has shown that homeschooling is growing at a rate of seven to 15 per cent per year , with millions of children currently learning at home . 	0
Indeed , that is a distinct possibility and the onus would have to be on the parents to ensure that does not happen . 	0
And , some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence . 	0
I ' m always fasinated by the ideology argument . 	0
But to just bring in services for one group flies in the face of equality . 	0
I think that religion should be either implemented for ALL religions ; or otherwise , for none . 	1
Doesn ’ t it make sense that they would therefore do a better job and that public schools would therefore do better in quantitative comparisons ? 	0
The public school system lets them deal with real life too , unfortunate that it may be but that is what ' s out there in college and the work force too . 	0
This is only a " compelling " argument to the MSNBC boobs who wrote this . 	0
Cooperative education ? 	0
A new , and sound , study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive . 	0

At the Tech school where I taught seniors once had five hours of shop class in the trade they came there to learn . 	0
I attended a single sex high school some 40 years ago . 	0
Granted that was a different day but still I cherish the memory . 	0
Adolescence is hard enough without having to try learning in an environment of hormone-laced competition and distraction . 	0
If I had teen-aged children today I would seek out single-sex education for them without hesitation . 	1
Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum . 	0
When I left that school , seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop ; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need , desire or use . 	0
The Supreme Court said that it violated the establishment clause of the Constitution to have this prayer , even though the prayer was a generic prayer . 	0
I went to public schools , I thrived in public schools - my mom MADE me go to public schools . 	0
Co-ed schools don ' t cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes , That ' s a myth . . . otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges ? 	0
Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside . 	0
No wonder why our educational standards are sliding . . 	0
Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt . 	0
Most Kids are distracted , do a lot of sexting , indulge / experiment in sexual acts , go on emotional outbursts ( act like adults ! ) and so on . . . 	0
You are a bad person if you don ' t do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible , and if that means sending your child to private school , that ' s what you do . 	1
So , does delaying kindergarten give kids a head start ? 	0
Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them , while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment . 	0
I found the attitude and behaviour of students in the co ed school to be better , and i attribute that to the influence of the opposite sex . 	0
IMO the only ' bad person ' here is the person writing the article . 	0
The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else . 	0
Even despite this range , the overall frequency is much lower than previously thought . 	0
However , evidence also indicates that age at school entry is a poor predictor of school success , with younger children performing just as well or better than their older peers . 	0
It appears that it can , at least for the first few years of elementary school , and this is especially true for kids who are already at risk for school difficulties due to socio-economic factors ( unfortunately those are also the kids who are least likely to start later ) . 	0
I have five Daughters and they all went to private schools and everyone of them have a degree and now have good paying jobs . 	0
Private schools get students ready for collage and they are given lots of attention . 	0

This is the caliber of people we have in some schools in the public system . 	0
This fool was reinforcing bad behavior . 	0
We used to call it " being held back " where I grew up . . . 	0
" Parents make that decision for all kinds of different reasons . 	0
Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school . 	0
On the school board etc . If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background . 	0
The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored . 	0
They need to bring back classes where all children ' s needs are met not just the worst behaved , why should the whole class be punished because one child ' s behaviour . 	0
Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade . 	0
They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence , attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students . 	0
In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed . 	0
We left and went from bored , hating school children to excited about learning , keen to get to school , enthused again . 	0
Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school . 	0
Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools . 	0
You want creativity , not teaching to the test . 	0
But there is in practice very limited access to these - it costs money , and these schools are few and far between . 	0
When Ed Balls thinks about all those children growing up uncontaminated by all this his head must nearly explode . 	0
One single ideology ! 	0
You want great outdoor space and small classrooms and personal attention . 	0
If you look at education philosophy and ideas it becomes clear that our current state school system is very much based on a narrow set of ideas . 	0
To not have an ideology - does this mean that you don ' t think that any other world view is acceptable , or that you simple don ' t think ? 	0
That it is wrong to do something because you belief it is right and have thought about the ideas behind it ! 	0
If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism , diversity , man-made climate change and sex education , even when their parents don ' t want it for them . 	0
I get it : You want an exceptional arts program and computer animation and maybe even Mandarin . 	0
The family are in the Old Bailey looking for compensation right now . 	0
They can use tutors , courses , other home educating parents , older children , other specialists with other skills and knowledge , books , science kits , a bought curriculum , internet resources etc etc . Home education is for most a community enterprise . 	0
You want a cohesive educational philosophy . 	0
Her son , now 13 , has a best friend one year younger than he is . 	0
Upon leaving my all girls school , I learned that someone there had told people I left due to a heroin addiction . 	0
I mean , WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! 	0
I asked them to tell me why . 	0
I later learned that I came off as a combination of snobby , shy and rude – simply because I hadn ’ t spent enough time in social situations or just being around the opposite sex , and I had no idea how to talk to them ! 	0
Switching schools changed that all for the better . 	0
Having spent middle school – those really developmental years , around very few boys – talking to them became a major cause of stress . 	0
I clammed up and couldn ’ t put a sentence together . 	0
The cattiness , hierarchy and estrogen rages became a whole other issue . 	0

I love my guy friends ; they have made me a die-hard Lakers fan , and I appreciate them just as much as my closest girlfriends . 	0

My daughter chose to attend public high school . 	0
In a school of 2 , 500 kids , less than 10% of the parents attended orientation . 	0
I sent my kids to a private , religious based school . 	0
I wanted my children to grow up with their faith being a part of their every day lives . 	0
Also , if your children attended this school , parent involvement was an expectation . 	0
As a result , every Home / School association meeting was packed . 	0
Everyone went to orientation . 	0
I knew the parents of every child my kids went to school with . 	0
Disipline was never a problem - if there was a concern with your child , you met with the teacher and / or the principle and worked out a solution . 	0

I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families . 	0
All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn : homemaking skills " . 	0
One of the girls , who has not been taught for two years , could be Josh Powell ' s twin . 	0
She is intelligent and desperate to learn , but her parents won ' t allow it . 	0
Thank you for bringing this tragedy to light . 	0
I am a Christian , an educator , a student and a parent and I have seen too many children like the Powells . 	0
As an admissions officer , we had applicants whose " record keeping " consisted of sending boxes full of paper for our office to review as part of the application . 	0

That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful . 	0
The point is not to fling those stereotypes back and forth , but to have a respectful discussion about the ideas of a home education versus a public standardized environment . 	0
And if any part of that made no sense , just point it out . 	0
I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child Or , more likely , it ' s a low to middle income parent , and they ' d rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work . 	0
Neither of these scenarios were true for me . 	0
My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff . 	0
She was ready , I sent her . 	0
As the morality of our society crashes , so , too , does the level of morality and level of education in our public schools . 	0
The evidence wasn ’ t very good then for a gap between the genders ’ learning styles so significant that it would mandate separate instruction , and it hasn ’ t gotten any better . 	0
Of course there are psychological and intellectual differences between men and women , but meta-analyses of the best studies show that those differences are relatively small , that there is a great deal of variability among individuals , and that , as the neuroscientist Lise Eliot writes , “ fundamentally , men and women are more similar than different . ” 	0
The best lawyers tend to make the most money . 	0
Men were hardwired for sleeping around and math , women for monogamy and English . 	0
Most people didn ’ t know much about brain science , but that didn ’ t stop them from trotting out vaguely recalled findings based on a handful of M . R . I . s showing that men and women thought differently . 	0
In one way , the fashion in single-sex classrooms has not changed at all . 	0
“ Math class is tough ! ” as that infamous talking Barbie complained . 	0
I remembered all this last week when I read about a new trend toward single-sex classrooms . 	0
Only about a dozen public schools were trying them in 2002 , but since the Department of Education relaxed its rules on gender-segregated classrooms , in 2006 , about five hundred public schools across the country have adopted them , according to an A . P . story . 	0
In May , the A . C . L . U . sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Alabama , Maine , Mississippi , West Virginia , and Virginia that have been separating boys and girls for academic instruction . 	0
Any personal experiences to share ? 	0
What do you think about kindergarten redshirting ? 	0
A lot of the academic stuff evens itself out by 3rd grade . 	0
Some kids take longer to learn subjects and it doesn ’ t necessarily mean they ’ re less smart than , say , kids who learned to read a year earlier . 	0
My child goes to public school , and if the school starts to suck then guess what I ' ll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can ' t fix stupid ! 	1
If my daughters can be in an environment that celebrates girls as intelligent , creative individuals , without the boy craziness ( and reducing of one ' s self to something befitting a boy ' s attention ) , than I will take it . 	0
No , you are not a " bad " person if you send your kids to private school . 	0
Most public schools cannot handle really " bright " kids . 	0
This is especially true at the elementary school level where they have to teach to the middle at best and the lower achieving kids most of the time . 	0
Why ? 	0
They have to teach to the test , so their focus is making sure their kids will pass the standardized tests that are given . 	0
Kids that are really bright , quick learners , etc . get bored and in a lot of cases start acting up . 	0

And if you want to know how much our children are at risk in terms of peer relationships , the media and more -- and how active parenting must be in our day -- please get hold of “ The Under Protective Parent ” series . 	0
Homeschooling is one of the ways we can fight back . 	0
He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged . 	0
We live in a day of under-protective parenting . 	0
It ’ s what lets you pick their friends and control the nature , speed and context of their broader socialization . 	0
It ’ s what lets you insulate them from the world before their maturity is ready to engage it on their own . 	0
It ’ s what allows you to optimally shape their spiritual life , and pour into it without contest during those years when there should be no contest . 	0
I hope and pray and that every parent will consider homeschooling their child at least through the most pivotal years , which to my thinking , is late elementary and middle school years . 	0
I cannot say this strongly enough . 	0
We had to have a GED or a degree from a correspondence school . 	0
Having multiple inclusion kids in a classroom can slow a class down . 	0
A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board . 	0
I have sent my son to private schools so that he could avoid the negative elements of society . 	0
Homeschool was very different when I was in school . 	0
What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence . . 	0
I ' m dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university . 	0
It wouldn ' t work anyhow . 	0
We ’ re working on such things and , in recent weeks , I ’ ve noticed a ton of positive changes in Ryan . 	0
A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost , private schools , 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools – those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment . 	0
Yet there is a consistent failure on the part of local authorities and government reviews to grasp even the basis of the ideas that can underlie a different kind of education . 	0
Evidence including our own suggests strongly that this kind of education prepares children to enter further and higher education , or the workforce – and offers them the freedom to learn in the ways that suit them best . 	0
We have half-a-year which means A LOT can change before kindergarten ( besides , since when did kids have to be perfect for kindergarten ? ) . 	0
It is here that home educators have their strongest reservations . 	0
And , most insidious of all , if the law were changed , social workers and education professionals would presumably be expected to monitor the quality of education provided . 	0
Research by ourselves at the University of London ' s Institute of Education has shown how diverse individual learners are , and therefore the diversity of ways in which their needs can best be met . 	0
Education at home is nothing like education at school . 	1
Styles of education can change between children and over time , bringing a flexibility and dynamism that would be impossible in a formal setting . 	0
Home education can range from the highly structured , based on set curriculums and lessons , to the completely informal . 	0
That school should be the benchmark against which all education is measured is resented by many home educators . 	0
While officials talk the language of individualism and chances for everybody , home educators are in a position to deliver precisely that kind of tailor-made education . 	0
After more than 25 years of severe moral decline is it not time to repent , reverence the name of the Lord , reinstitute and keep the third commandment ? 	0
I believe everyone deserves an education , and much more than the 12 years we get , but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children ! 	0
As a matter of fact , as a homeowner , I am supporting both systems , much more than those less fortunate can . 	0
You actively , with forethought , work to deny your child an education ? 	0
Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools . 	0
Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school . 	0
It would be silly to sacrifice him to public schools to make them better . 	0
In recent years , the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education , leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time , and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence . 	0
It comes from 2 Chronicles 7 : 14 which is summarized as “ If we pray , seek , turn ; then God hears , forgives , heals . ” 	0

The article is written from the professor ' s perspective and he writes about his experience in teaching Jonas and some of the issues that he felt Jonas dealt with in the class . 	0
In the article , the professor describes the first day of class and how Jonas asked him if there would be a paper required for the course in which the professor responded that was how the previous course was taught and that he would solicit the thoughts of the class and he noticed how Jonas ' demeanor changed with his answer . 	0
Granted , public education , like most other government programs , is corrupt at it ' s core and an administrative nightmare , it needs to be completely overhauled , but the fact remains that the populace needs to be educated and if not forced by law , a lot of parents simply wouldn ' t bother , paying for their kid ' s education gets in the way of the new car and the designer jeans . 	1
If you come out on the other side deficient , it ’ s hard to make up for that . 	0
There are many elements that come into play when mainstreaming special education students into regular education settings . 	0
Teachers will need to educate themselves so they can learn different strategies to teach two diverse groups , exceptional students and " regular " students , in the same classroom . 	0
The inclusive classroom is different in that the individualized styles of learning and needs of the students fall outside the normal parameter . 	0
Sometimes it is not only the teacher that is resistant but the exceptional students as well are resistant to the change in educational setting because they are used to being separated from the mainstream of school life . 	0
This is where teamwork will become important between the school , the students , and the teachers . 	0
The inclusive classroom is a different dynamic so everyone will have to adjust but the transition will be easier with cooperation from everyone . 	0
I read an article on a particular student named Jonas , a previous special education high school student , and his experience in a college setting . 	0
Jonas is presently a special education assistant or para-professional in a urban high school and he is taking the undergraduate course , Critical Issues in School , to complete his degree . 	0
Second , special education students typically have some modifications or accommodations written in their Individualized Education Plan . 	0
For a special education student , this is magnified tremendously . 	0
Traditional students also try to refrain from asking questions in class because they don ' t want to look dumb . 	0
I say that because I love my country and it really bothers me to see our politicians drag us down further and further in to the abyss . 	0
When classes are filled with 36 to 40 students per class , one-on-one instruction becomes impossible . 	0
In addition , special education students tend to need more one-on-one instruction without distractions . 	0
This means that the students choose to take the test in class — and have attention drawn to them because they get special treatment in other students eyes — or they take their test in the testing center where they can have more privacy . 	0
Oftentimes , their plan allows them to use notes , a calculator and / or textbooks on tests . 	0
I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don ' t attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition . 	0
And as a parent of two " youngest in the class " , I wonder if these redshirt parents ' choice will be subjecting other children , who ' s parents followed the rules , to a school life of struggling to keep up with classmates that should actually be in another class ? 	0
I have always taken time to help as many students as possible , both traditional and special education students . 	0
Lastly , special education teachers catch on quickly which traditional teachers are going to take the time to help the kids on their case load . 	0
Redshirting - does it really buy your child a long-term advantage in school and in life ? 	0
We choose to be the primary influence in our children ’ s life and know it is the right decision for our family . 	0
In fact , the National Home Education Research Institute disclosed that the 36 to 54 hours that students spend in school-related weekly activities make peers and adults outside of the home the primary influences in children ' s lives - not the parents . 	0
But lack of socialization for homeschoolers is really just a myth that holds no weight and is not a valid reason to not consider homeschooling . 	0
Each parent and family must make the decision to do what is best for them whether it be public school or homeschool . 	0
Mr . Safer also failed to examine the long-term effects of redshirting on children as the proceed thru their academic life . 	0
I sure hope somebody is out there studying these old , bigger , more mature students as they progress thru their school years ? 	0
I was all alone my freshmen year , by my senior year , there were enough high school homeschoolers to count on two hands . 	0
I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child ' s education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children . 	0
I think that where inclusion is being considered , it has to be carefully planned to meet the childs needs . 	0
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good , loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy . 	0
The subjects were deemed too difficult to teach at home . 	0
Public schools will never get better until they have competition . 	0
so my kids should suffer for the school systems down fall while we figure it out . . . . news flash change takes time and you only have kids in school for a short time . . . . 	0
I wish . 	0
No one is claiming " the professionals " are the only ones who can teach . 	0
Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks , the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance . 	0
I will always be happy they were happy there , despite my misery . 	0
And so children die . 	0
If no one is checking up , no one has noticed their child ' s bruises and withdrawal and misery . 	0
So , some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught . 	0
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents , teachers notice and they report it . 	0
It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people . 	0
It is not a widespread problem , no one is claiming that . 	0
There is no way to tell who any of us would have been different without having the experience . 	0
Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose . 	0
Comes up in conversation ? 	0
I don ' t hide it . 	0
" they want to put her in G&T " -- now seriously , it ' s not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don ' t brag to the world about it . 	0

Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature ( August birthday ) . 	0
Now she ' s in 2nd and all I hear is " she ' s so smart " " she ' s bored . " 	0
But this holding them back because they are immature ? 	1
No way - not a good reason IMO . . . because they will grow up , , they will mature . 	1
Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many " redshirted " kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers . 	0
I ' m all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready . 	0
Nope , public school not for me ! 	1
Who in their right mind would want their children to have to rely on an education from one of those to prepare them for life ? 	0
You ' ve got to be kidding . 	0
The public school system the way it is now is not an option . 	1
Plus , I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution . 	0
This is still a country where your successes do provide some benefits . 	0
Education is one . 	0
I hope that the government doesn ' t make that impossible to . 	0
Just look at public schools . 	0
If you want what is best for your child , you ' ll send them to a private school . 	1
I think the idea that sending all children to public schools is a poor way to bring public education up to grade . 	0
Most would say , not at the expense of my child , and they would be right . 	0
The entire socialist mentality has no place here in the United States . 	0
I am going to be starting a single sex school but am not intimidated by this at all , as it was not just my parents choice but mine too , alot of people I know quite well go there and enjoy it tremendisly . 	0
Its just a debate that has two extremely good arguments on both sides 	0
Not sure how it would have turned out if we ' d sent him straight through , but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically , professionally , and socially . 	0
Testimony : My son , now 25 , was held back by going to Transitional first grade ( T1 ) . 	0
I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us . 	0
He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship ; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years , and earned another scholarship to get his masters ; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating . 	0
I know it ' s a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision , I know its tough and is different for each child . 	0
I am a loving , knowledgeable , intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life . 	0
These parents are paying for public schools as well with tax dollars . 	0
People sending their kids to private schools and homeschooling actual helps the public schools . 	0
By helping pay for it , but not sending their children there , they are increasing the amount of funds that are available per student . 	0
Constitutionally , Canada has no religion , although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground . 	0
Lets keep it that way . 	0
There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion ' s prayer services . 	1
I do not care if the person is Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Zorastrian , Buddhist , Jainist , Wiccan , Protestant , Catholic , Orthodox , or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government . 	0
My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable . 	0
Nobody needs to be practicing religion at a public school . 	1
The whole point is to separate education from religion . 	0
If you want your kid learning and praying in the same place then send them to a religious school . 	0
if you had to do something and be child free during that time , the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block . 	0
your kid turned 5 , you sent them to KINDERGARTEN , boom , done . 	0
too often , parents are doing it because it ' s the done thing now , not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child ; someone said it was a good idea , so they did it . we didn ' t put our daughter in day care , pre-school , or 4K ; ppl thought we were nuts . 	0
now , parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up , get them ahead of their peers , send them to umpteen different activities , get them in pre-school , and now this redshirting thing . 	0
dept . on the cheap , the dance classes , soccer , softball , on and on ad nauseum . 	0
this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid . . . perhaps for some parents , there ' s some truth to it . when i was a kid , back in the dark ages , there wasn ' t day care , pre-school , 4 year old kindergarten , we didn ' t have all these things kids can do via the rec . 	0
there wasn ' t even the designation of 5K ; there was just KINDERGARTEN . 	0
when i was a kid , i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten , where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten . 	0
There are many religions that do not pray to their gods , and some that don ' t have any gods whatsoever . 	0
2 ) The 1st amendment clearly establishes ( heh heh get it ) that the government may not sponsor a religion . 	0
One of the biggest myths about homeschooled kids is that they are poorly socialized . 	0
A study by the Canadian Center for Home Education found homeschooled young people at 15-34 years of age more socially engaged ( 67% ) compared with their public school educated peers ( 44% ) . 	0
It ' s not . 	0
4 ) It forces children to think that religion is okay . 	0
Prayer is solely religious in nature . 	0
3 ) Not only that , but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general . 	0
I found it fascinating that homeschooled children , who are not being taught to the test , on the whole do much better than their public school counterparts . 	0
The statistics showing the higher test scores may be skewed because parents of homeschooled kids are not required to take or report scores for standardized tests in many states . 	0
Homeschooled students do have more time to pursue extracurricular activities as opposed to their exhausted public school peers . 	0
Teachers teach to the test because that is what they are instructed to do by administrations that are under pressure for government funding . 	0
Some parents bring in tutors or enroll their children in enrichment programs driving up the cost . 	0
Many parents recycle curriculum among siblings , get groups together for the group rate when visiting museums , and get free materials from the library or online to cut costs . 	0
In public school everyone must take standardized tests and schools must report the scores . 	0
The cost of homeschooling varies widely . 	0
It really is that simple . 	0
But the state ( including the public schools ) cannot mandate , sponsor , conduct , or otherwise officially sanction prayer . 	1
Private individuals can pray whenever and wherever they want ; no one ’ s personal freedoms are being abridged in this regard . 	1
( They can ’ t even offer to lead purely “ voluntary ” prayers with an “ opt out ” option for non-praying students ; that ’ s still a form of religious participation and support , on an official basis , by the state — which is flatly unconstitutional ) . 	0
Ergo , public schools ( e . g . , the state ) may not lead or conduct prayers . 	0
U . S . public schools , being government-run and taxpayer-supported , are part of “ the state . ” 	0
The state may not establish , endorse , promote , sponsor , or conduct prayers . 	0
Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice , and give free expression to their own private religious preferences ; however , the state cannot do likewise ( because the U . S . Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote , endorse , or otherwise “ establish ” religion ) . 	0
However , teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals , but as employees ( and hence representatives ) of the state . 	0
It is sometimes objected that teachers ’ rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated , if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer . 	0
However , when they want to pray out loud or with a group , I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable . 	0
While one child may be an extreme extrovert and need to be surrounded by students and in a classroom , another may be an extreme introvert , overwhelmed and anxious in the classroom . 	0
The private and Catholic schools were grew out of the need created because the public schools sucked " first " . 	0
If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are ' stuck ' there demanded better , likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools . 	0
If the problems could be solved by more involved parents ( and a majority of them probably can be ) , then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved . 	0
You ' re blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust ( often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure ) yet ignoring the obvious . 	0
IF this were true , then why don ' t the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it ? 	0
They deserve better . 	0
If the atmosphere in the school is right , if the pastoral care excellent than I feel that the co-ed environment creates a vibrant , exciting , stimulating school but also a more relaxed and less stressful climate . 	0
As a boy in a boarding school myself many years ago , which was single sex until A levels , the arrival of girls in the sixth form was the worst possible distraction to teenage boys about to embark serious exams . 	0
Girls also feel the pressure of exam much more than boys and in their teenage years exam pressure can become very intense with often very serious negative consequences . 	0
My experience in a secondary co-ed is that the co-ed situation does deflect some of this tension . 	0
But in my opinion it should be from 2-18 . 	0
Boys and girls perhaps learn differently and approach work in different ways . 	0
If a school is aware of this and teachers can adapt styles and vary their teaching strategies – I see co-eds as both a more natural and realistic preparation for the fast approaching lesson of adult life . 	1
This can cause children to not experience as much about society and those different from them as they would in a public or private school setting . 	0
Experiences are left out of childhood that could have been gained through attendance at school in a multicultural classroom . 	0
Finances Finances can be difficult for families when children are homeschooled . 	0
With one parent teaching children in the comfort of your own home , the other is left to be sole " breadwinner , " and that can place a burden on a family ' s budget . 	0
Many schools also provide a free lunch to students in order to aid families during this tough economic time , something that cannot be offered while homeschooling . 	0
Isolation from Differences Children are isolated from differences in race , ethnicity , age and culture when being homeschooled . 	0
Ideally , I don ’ t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age , let alone sex . 	1
The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training . 	0
In a rough analogy to monocultural farming , I think than any highly homogeneous group of people , while it offers certain efficiencies , is inherently pathology prone . 	0
Diversity damps extremes of outlook , need and behavior . 	0
She compares the push toward mainstreaming students from special education classes to the 1980s movement to downsize mental health institutes , which resulted in an increase in homelessness because individuals could no long receive needed supports . 	0

The reformers ’ talk was all about “ How Schools Shortchange Girls ” ( the title of a much-discussed report from the American Association of University Women ) or were “ Failing at Fairness ” ( the title of a 1994 book ) for young women . 	0
My view on the subject is no . 	1
and I actually do feel like co-ed schools develop a girl better socially and emotionally than all-girls schools , just from the mere fact that a girl will get to interact with boys on a daily basis . 	0
As Halpern and her co-authors point out , there are some excellent single-sex programs , and some can point to real gains , but often these can be attributed to selection bias—the children involved were more committed students—and to the motivation and sense of mission among teachers and staff . 	0
In an article called , bluntly , “ The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Schooling , ” which was co-authored by Diane Halpern , a research psychologist at Claremont McKenna college , and published in Science magazine this fall , Halpern et al . conclude that “ there is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students ’ academic performance . ” 	0
A woman whose daughters attend one of the West Virginia middle schools with boys ’ and girls ’ classes contributed an article this week to the A . C . L . U . Web site in which she pointed out that her school ’ s all-male classes operated on the humane assumption that many kids concentrate better if they ’ re permitted to move about a bit . 	0
When I was reporting on single-sex education experiments in the nineties , one of the things I noticed was that teaching methods enthusiastically billed as better for girls , like hands-on science demonstrations , or mixing word problems in with more standard equations , would be better for anyone without a natural bent for math or science . 	0
She thought , reasonably enough , that some girls might benefit from a little of the same freedom . 	0
In the boys ’ classes , students could lounge in beanbag chairs and run around outside sometimes to “ blow off steam . ” 	0
In the nineties , it was girls . 	0
What has changed since the nineties is the notion of who single-sex education is supposed to help most . 	0
We should make the public system as good as possible for those who can ' t afford it but if parents want their kids to get a better education than the system provides don ' t stop them . 	0
I went to a private school and the public system could never have given me the same experience and quality education . 	0

He enjoys his preschool activities but if he had to do everything over again , I envision lots of fussing about going to school . 	0
Mornings would be ugly . 	0

No one wants a kid to develop the habit of tuning out . 	0
Ryan also is like me in that he ’ s observant and listening intensely , although if you didn ’ t know him , or me , you might think we ’ re not paying attention . 	0
But trust me , we have mentally filed away every detail of interest and can almost recite word-for-word what was said . 	0
Here ’ s another thing : A bored Ryan is trouble waiting to happen . 	0
I cannot imagine him spending a year not moving forward with his learning . 	0
They pay most , if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools . 	0
Just who do you think pays for the schools ? 	0
A very few excel , but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling , so they exceled in spite of public schools . 	0

I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins . 	0
It ' d be good to read up on the literature . 	0
My first thoughts are that it would be more likely to produce an objectified view even with regular cross school events . 	0
Yes , private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do . 	0
My husband and I both work and make good money , but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget . 	0
I suggest reading a blog I wrote earlier this year titled “ Parents , Sports and Church . ” 	0
All I would add to its words would be that as someone who played competitive sports himself at almost every level , and saw my homeschooled kids engage them at almost every level as well , it ’ s a red herring . 	0
I have two children . 	0
My daughter who is a Junior attends public school and my son who is a Sophomore is in his first year at private school . 	0

She excels in public school . 	0
My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3 . 8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes . 	0
He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do . 	0

I don ' t think it works , unless all classes are small ( 15 max ) and all children with needs have one to one help . 	1
I am a victim of this latter possibility . 	0

these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time , maybe i can see it , IF these kids are doing something to help them in w / e area they are lacking , but to do it for sports , or just because they need that one extra year to " just be a kid " ? 	0

If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several ( is it 6 ? ) times a day , and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly . . . why is this prayer only being conducted once per week ? 	0
This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands . 	0
I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship . 	0
And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property . 	0
She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it , not just academically , but also socially . 	0

Take heed that when a parent chooses homeschool over public school , it was not without considering all the pros and cons on both sides . 	0
In the end , whether they chose one or the other , it was because they thought it was best for their child ! 	0
Let us stop the nonsense , and abuse . 	0
I agree that HS isn ' t what it used to be , there are a lot more resources . 	0
The program provides the necessary leisure and opportunity to foster better ties with your child . 	0
This aspect of homeschooling program wins the greatest favor from parents of onlies . 	0
Confidence , self-esteem , pride , self respect are qualities that have to be nurtured by the school too and if the school fails in providing a conducive environment , the parents can take the next step of doing the schooling for their child on their own . 	0

With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money , hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform ! 	0

Just getting rid of public schools isn ' t going to get rid of problem students and SOMEONE is going to have to deal with them . 	0

The stereotype that home learners spend their days isolated from society at kitchen tables with workbooks in hand could be nothing but farther from reality . 	0
The practice is even more common in charter schools according to statistics . 	0
Our culture has declared war on children in so many ways . 	0
Let ’ s take a look at this . 	0
There seems to be a myth that homeschoolers do not receive proper socialization . 	0
This usually comes from people who do not understand homeschooling or those deeply involved in public education . 	0
In reality , the majority of homeschoolers are provided with plenty of social opportunities . 	0
There has been much discussion regarding homeschooling lately . 	0
He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten . 	0
As a homeschooling parent of five children for over a decade , the most frequent question I receive is , “ what about socialization ? ” 	0
A woman recently contacted me saying she desired to homeschool her child but the socialization issue was keeping her from doing so . 	0
Well , getting drunk before basketball games with kids who lived at the trailer park near my house did the same for me . 	0
Reading Walt Whitman in ninth grade changed the way you see the world ? 	0
As rotten as my school ’ s English , history , science , social studies , math , art , music , and language programs were , going to school with poor kids and rich kids , black kids and brown kids , smart kids and not-so-smart ones , kids with superconservative Christian parents and other upper-middle-class Jews like me was its own education and life preparation . 	0
I ' m happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision . 	1
Take two things from this on your quest to become a better person : 1 ) Your child will probably do just fine without “ the best , ” so don ’ t freak out too much , but 2 ) do freak out a little more than my parents did—enough to get involved . 	0
( Can you imagine ? ) 	0
They sent me there because that ’ s where we lived , and they weren ’ t too worried about it . 	0
By the way : My parents didn ’ t send me to this shoddy school because they believed in public ed . 	0
My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off . 	0
Many of my ( morally bankrupt ) colleagues send their children to private schools . 	0
He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well , considering he is the youngest in the class . 	0
In reality , children and teens are locked behind gates on campus , are segregated by age , are forced to remain silent in class unless called by the teacher , and whose schedules are determined by the blare of school bells . 	0
In contrast , a homeschooler ’ s “ classroom ” is the world around him / her . 	0
Parents don ’ t just limit teaching their children in the living or dining room . 	0
They hold lessons in parks , libraries or museums . 	0
However , Dr . Thomas Smedley debunked these assumptions when he did a study on homeschooled kids . 	0
Last year , his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year . 	0
Homeschooled children scored very high in the 84th percentile compared to public school students who scored at an abysmal 23rd percentile . 	0
Public schools argue that their kids are better socialized . 	0
Pre-K was only 3 hours long , while Kindergarten was a full day . 	0
They take weekly field trips to places of interest in the community , including churches , colleges , hospitals , fire departments , city halls , and even repair shops . 	0
Indeed , parents ensure that their kids are able to interact with people of all ages , and not just with their peers . 	0
If you want to chat with your invisible , supernatural friend do so off school property and on your own time . 	0
Our education system ( as with our government ) must remain secular and free from these silly distractions . 	0
NO PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ! . . . period . 	1
While there are many arguments for homeschooling children , there are several reasons that parents might not want to pursue this educational option . 	0
This large step should be considered carefully before children are either homeschooled or enrolled at a public institution . 	0
Homeschooling allows children to move at their own learning pace , yet it can socially isolate them . 	0
Homeschooling is beneficial for some , but may not be right for every family . 	0
Also , teaching itself can be difficult , as parents usually haven ' t earned a degree in education and occasionally they don ' t even have any kind of post-secondary education . 	0
Social Networks Children who are homeschooled can lack the social interaction gained by having classmates . 	0
Teaching Many parents find the variety of choices and lesson plans that can be used for homeschooling overwhelming . 	0
Since there are no laid out plans for teaching , homeschooling can be a great deal of work for parents , and occasionally confusing for children . 	0
This can be difficult for children as they can be socially isolated unless parents create their own social groups through sports , extracurricular activities or religious organizations . 	0
The value of learning how to get along with others and develop social skills that will be needed throughout life is an important part of the education experience . 	0
My child changes every year and so will his needs . 	1
So bored ! 	0
NONE . 	0
I can ' t imagine tossing them into PreK again for another year . 	0

Actually , my son had a homeschooled boy on his hockey team for several years . 	0
Home educated children are also more involved in their communities , as are adults who were homeschooled . 	0
The top reason my friends say they didn ’ t consider homeschooling is because they are sure their kids won ’ t listen to them . 	0
He socialized just fine and was exceptionally bright , though judging from his fascination with my garage door opener , seemed a bit sheltered . 	0
Many readers addressed this saying it ’ s a matter of discipline and good parenting . 	0
I have to say , I ’ m with them . 	0
Someone out there should start a consulting business teaching parents how to get their kids to listen to them while homeschooling . 	0
Although there is a huge homeschool community out there that makes it work , I still can ’ t imagine my boys cooperating . 	0
Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school . 	0
He went in a boy and came out a god-loving man of character ! 	0
The subject of homeschool shouldn ' t open a firestorm of debate anymore than mentioning a child is going to public school opens a debate . 	0
This is after all a free country . 	0
It depends on what you think a Christian is . 	0
There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone . 	0
Not surpirsingly the worst behavior problems are lower potential and high potential students . 	0
But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others . 	0
Well , of course the whole Bible isn ' t mythology . 	0
There is some religious laws , there is a lot of poetry , there is some history , and there is a lot of mythology . 	0
How else should Genesis be characterized ? 	0
Nonsense . 	0
As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion . 	0
I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk . 	0
Carry it in your brief case , but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line . 	0
My child went to a private all boys school and it was the best thing I ever did ! 	1
As a teacher , this is a moral and ethical struggle for me . 	0
In public school , the parents nor the teachers have too much say in the government run institutions ! 	0
I don ' t know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized , so much as motivated . 	0
( though organization does help . ) 	0
This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings . 	0
Ergo , if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district , you ' re damn right I ' m going to put them in a private school if I ' m able to do it . 	1
I ' m not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point . 	0
When preparing for a test , the boys may go for a run , or engage in some other activity , while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises , such as yoga . ” 	0

I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school , and it is really easy to be like " Well , we ' ll get back on track tomorrow . " 	0
Girls thrive on team projects and collaboration ; boys on bright lights , loud voices , and competition . 	0
I ’ m saying that I survived it , and so will your child , who must endure having no AP calculus so that in 25 years there will be AP calculus for all . 	0
This year it may be homeschool . 	1
Isn ' t this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms ! 	0
In a study conducted by Dr . Michael Mitchell , traits for successful socialization in students include popularity among peers , aggressive competitiveness , pride and self-confidence , and a drive toward materialism . 	0
A second point to consider is that there is an obvious discrepancy between public school educators and homeschoolers on what traits define successful socialization . 	0
It ’ s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is . 	0
With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he ’ s six . 	1
You son sounds like he ’ s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise . 	0
He wasn ’ t ready for kindergarten though . 	0
I know my oldest was and it ’ s just now in the fourth grade that he ’ s really catching up to his peers . 	0
He sounds like he ’ s mostly ready , but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class . 	0
I think you really have to know your own child . 	0
As I stated earlier , mainstream was the right move for me , however I do not regret my time spent in The Court . 	0
To my mind , this is not an issue with a quick fix solution , nor are there any definitive answers on what ’ s better for disabled children . 	0
This means that teachers can spend more time on each pupil , answering any questions or concerns they may have about the tasks set . 	0
In contrast , homeschoolers want their children to focus on building character and integrity , developing a sense of responsibility , and respect toward others – ideals of Christian living . 	0
So I would argue that all provision for disabled pupils ( and students ) needs defending whether its special schools , SEN ( special education needs ) departments in mainstream schools or learning support assistants . 	0
To that end , the ‘ integration vs . segregation ’ argument simply becomes an argument that is abstract and separate from reality . 	0
I feel that it is almost certain that ‘ special ’ education will always be necessary for some school-students and ultimately it is their needs which should form the focus of this debate . 	0
It provided me with the first steps in my education . 	0
I hope disabled people , carers , teachers and parents can consider this possibility the next time this debate arises . 	0
The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher . 	0
At public it ' s payment in full at private it ' s payment in full or pay the difference . 	0
It was said that a ' voucher system ' would eventually be put in place , where by the funding attached to each student would ' travel ' with the student . 	0
Not surprisingly , delinquent and antisocial behaviors are practically non-existent in homeschooled children . 	0
This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community . 	0
" If he ' s older , he won ' t be easily manipulated into drug use and malpractices like this . 	0
As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of ' schools of last resort ' . 	0
He might feel more confident dealing with older students , " she said . 	0
Just as Gibb made a choice depending on her son ' s emotional needs , Vela recommends that parents do the same . 	0
I don ' t necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school . 	0
If she was down one grade it wouldn ' t make much difference socially since she is SO far off , but she would be further ahead with academics , totally bored , and would have other issues there as a result . 	0
She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically . 	0
If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th . 	0
You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics . 	0
It doesn ' t matter what the cut-off date is , there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not . 	0
Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature . 	0
Tracy Gibb , a mother , blogger of Less than Perfect , deliberately redshirted her son because she thought he was emotionally immature . 	0
My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that ' s a big reason we sent her to Christian private school . 	0
I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy , as he would then " blow " , much to the amusement of everyone . 	0
Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL , and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school . 	0
" When he complains about his friend , I always try to remind him that he is one year younger than him and that he was doing the same things last year , " Gibb told ABCNews . com . 	0
Gibb still thinks she made the right choice not only because her son was " emotionally immature , " but also because she did not want him to join high school or college at a very young age . 	0
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS . 	0

So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school ; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country . 	0
The hell with do they know how to read , write , etc . The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda , do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom , Christianity is evil but don ' t hurt the sweet people of Isam ' s feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace . 	0
Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ , WRITE , SPELL , do MATH , SCIENCE , HISTORY , but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too . 	0
Lets see here . 	0
Hmmm . . . . 	0
there ' s no social advantage at all ; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school ! 	0
there ' s no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year , if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college , or if you won ' t or can ' t teach them on your own . 	0
all this pressure i see on other kids , and where ' s the benefit ? 	0
she takes one dance class , 45 minutes every saturday , because she asked if she could , not because i think it ' s good for much of anything ; she likes to dance and maybe she ' ll learn to not be such a clod . 	0
i am in the somewhat , these days , enviable position of being a stay at home mom , and i am a nerdy book worm , so it ' s easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education , and in such a way that she doesn ' t think she ' s being taught , ha ha sneaky mom . 	0
what DO you do , if you hold them back that first year ? 	0
the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school , because they both work , and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school ? 	0
how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that , as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs ? 	0
but , no , i don ' t see it . if you want your kid to just be a kid , DON ' T put them in all these activities , unless they ASK to do them . 	0
i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting , and yes , i have looked , because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it , but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same . 	0
But , say a classmate has died . 	0
If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different . 	0
If prayer really works , then students might turn to God and come to know His love and forgiveness . 	0
Alliance Defending Freedom stands with See You at the Pole and with every student who desires to call upon the name of God . 	0
My husband helped update plumbing . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then a group of students gathering around a flagpole early in the morning to talk to God would pose no threat . 	0
If prayer didn ’ t work , then FFRF would not find it “ unfortunate ” that students are encouraged to “ reach out to [ their ] classmates who do not know God ’ s love and forgiveness . ” 	0
In 2006 , then Education Secretary Margaret Spellings eased federal regulations on the policy , allowing schools to offer single-sex classrooms and schools so as long as these options are completely voluntary . 	0
If prayer really works , then it is a threat to those who would seek to corrupt a generation of students into embracing a godless worldview . 	0
The theme of this year ’ s See You at the Pole is #IFTHEN . 	0
And during a moment of silence , cannot some students pray and others reflect ? 	0
To FFRF and groups like it , the threat of prayer at school is the “ then . ” 	0
The threat is that when students pray , then God responds . 	0
The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system . . . not to parents . 	0
As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class . 	0
This is where money talks , if you want to make a change or have a say in your child ' s education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best ( private school ) . 	1
The author assumes parents can change a public system . 	0
The flaw . 	0
If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents . . it is not it is to serve and teach the children . 	0
This is not so . 	0
This worked really well . 	0
On top of all this , we also paid taxes to the public school . 	0
I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails . 	0
It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible . 	0
I can see disallowing vocal prayer . 	1
A school is a public institution . 	0
It might offend some people . 	0
Inconsiderate bigots . 	0
What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion ? 	0
But , of course . 	0
These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs . 	0
To hell with everyone else . 	0
The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them . 	0
When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them . 	0
As with any generalization , there are exceptions to the rule , but this is what I have seen . 	0
First , students with learning disabilities tend to be self conscious of the fact that they have a learning disability . 	0
There are , however , special education students with more severe disabilities who do stay in a different classroom , but those students are few and far between . 	0
Nowadays , special education students are in regular education classes along with everyone else . 	0
Things have changed tremendously since then . 	0
When I was in high school , special education students had their own wing in the school and mostly stayed there for all of their classes . 	0
Here is my experience . 	0
There can be , however , a few road blocks for special education students , parents and teachers . 	0
I have had several of them in my math classes , and they have generally been some of the best students . 	0
I think mainstreaming special education students is wonderful . 	1
For Zach homeschooling meant greater stability . 	0
He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it . 	0
In the University , I found out what they didn ' t teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year . 	0
The idea is that a child needs extra time to catch up , whether physically , academically or emotionally . 	0
He would be one of the youngest kindergarteners–and because of this , I also have the option to hold him back ( or redshirt him ) . 	0
this was 1970 . 	0
Nobody seemed to care what we did . 	0
This is nuts . 	0
I went to a crappy high school . 	0
Half a year . 	0
We still have spring and summer before autumn Two whole seasons . 	0
Back-to-school season is far from my mind . 	0
It ’ s snowing as I write this . 	0
My son Ryan turns 5 in May and , under our school district ’ s cutoff dates , he is eligible to start elementary school this fall . 	0
Like many parents of children with late-spring and summer birthdays , I must decide RIGHT NOW whether my child should begin kindergarten next year or repeat preschool . 	0
In most parts of the country , it ’ s time to register your 4- and 5-year-olds for kindergarten . 	0
But no matter . 	0
After this period , the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence , the brain cannot develop " richly and normally any real cognitive system , including language . " http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say : " Only in America ! " 	0
These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll . 	0
This is because language acquisition therories tell us that , " there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally . 	0
Redshirting a trend ? 	0
This is insane ! 	0
The Liberal Democrats , Black Racists , Ignorant Civil Rights nuts , Atheist , and the ACLU have made our Public School System a disgrace to education . 	0

Jesus ’ teaching on oath-taking recorded in Matthew 5 : 33-37 , while often misinterpreted , is actually a strong affirmation of the third commandment and a clear warning that “ the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain ” ( Exodus 20 : 7 ) . 	0
Not in Public Schools . 	0
Each and every family has the right to evaluate their child or children and their needs . 	0
I know that there are some very competent and dedicated private school teachers , but in general , how could they outperform public school teachers , who make so much more money ? 	0
Each choice , regardless of your opinion on homeschool or public school , should be respected . 	0
No one knows their child like them and the entire debate of homeschool versus public school is moot , except between mom and dad . 	0
That angle is in choosing what it best for my child this year . 	1
One thing is for sure . 	0
Next year it may be public school . 	1
What are the factors you considered when making this decision for your child ? 	0
I plan to see how that age assortment goes for him as it may mirror what we will encounter in kindergarten . 	0
This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3 ′ s classroom , he will be in a young 4 ′ s room that ranges from 3 1 / 2 to 4 1 / 2 . 	0
Taken together , the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially . 	0
In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit . 	0
But , at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older , and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger . 	0
Socially , I do wonder if being older would be helpful for him , especially since in adolescence it is socially advantageous for boys to hit puberty early ( it is risk factor for girls ) because that means physical strength . 	0
After his first day of preschool he was disappointed because “ I didn ’ t learn anything . ” 	0
I think he is a kid who is in danger of getting bored in a less stimulating / demanding environment . 	0
I know nothing about poetry , very little about art , and please don ’ t quiz me on the dates of the Civil War . 	0

This is not a humblebrag ! 	0
I left home woefully unprepared for college , and without that preparation , I left college without having learned much there either . 	0
You know all those important novels that everyone ’ s read ? 	0

Of course , we all know that bad parents exist . 	0
But typically , the state tends to make the worst parent of all , and I don ' t need its kinds of lessons . 	0
Only a fortnight ago a report was published by Robin Alexander and his team at Cambridge University which found that the primary school curriculum is too narrow and involves too much testing . 	0
Rather than taking on the challenge of addressing existing problems in a failing system run by overworked and pressured staff , Ed Balls is making a scapegoat of those who have chosen to work outside of that system , and blame them for noticing the government ' s educational failings . 	0
The reason for this is that kids and teens are getting their “ socialization education ” from other adults and their peers , without the guidance of their parents . 	0
Lastly , it is important to mention that these same negative values in public school are what is causing the increase in delinquent behavior , including drug abuse , sexual promiscuity , violence , emotional and psychological disorders , just to name a few . 	0

One of my now close friends told me long after we met that when she initially saw my name and profession on our playgroup roster , she thought , “ oh great . ” 	0
*** The real solution to improve the education system is , give every family with kids a voucher . 	0
The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school . 	0
For that under privileged family it ' s a blessing , but for my family it was sad . 	0
The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one . 	0
Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now " retirement safe " this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood . 	0
Each mother shared their respective observations of their kids , explaining how they came to their decision , when one mother interrupted , turned to me , pointed , and said , “ I want to know what you would do . 	0
Not all public schools suck , but most do . 	1
Some teachers need to be fired , some retired , and some need to change vocations . 	0
But Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school . 	0
The topic quickly changed to kindergarten entrance , which was charged with palatable anxiety over whether their child should start this coming year or wait a year . 	0
Prayer is something that needs to be and should be taught in the home , by parents . 	0

Adelman , an orthopedic surgeon in Seattle , is an advocate for inclusion of special education students in regular classrooms — a practice often called mainstreaming . 	0
“ It does not mean no work gets done ; only you take a longer time to explore what works for you and your child . 	0
Believe me , it can be a luxury . 	0
Parents put their kids on a Public School Bus , or drop them off at a Public School . 	0
When they do , they never know if they will ever see their child alive again , or have their child ' s innocence stolen from them , or have their child ' s future altered and scared forever . 	0
Most Parents want to send their kids to private schools . 	0
We exchanged basic information about each other , you know , where we live , how many kids we have , what we do for a living . 	0
Academics ? 	0
The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children . 	0
Emotional Security Bullying , peer pressure , teasing , competitive feelings are real issues that can mar the experience of a regular school for a child . 	0
Particularly for parents of only children , these issues often take nightmarish proportions ( and probably rightly so ) considering the deep care and protectiveness they offer their child . 	0
The principle seems straightforward – through registration , all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities , who could then protect them – and ensure that the education being received is adequate . 	0
If you want children to pray at school , there are plenty of Catholic and other private schools available . 	0
This is because they want the children to know , there is a price for acting up . 	0
I have seen in the public system , where a principal would give candy to the children that act up , to not do it again . 	0
It ' s ironic to me that the folks most likely to kvetch about all those worthless teachers and teachers unions are the ones who will then turn around and demand those teachers should be able to lead their students in prayer . 	0
Let me say , as a parent and as a Christian , I don ' t want my daughter ' s teacher or her principal or her classmates leading her in prayer in school — including what someone else might consider " good Christian prayer " or else some watered-down pablum generic invocation . 	1
That ' s why we go to church on Sundays , not the local middle school cafeteria . 	0

He got sent to the office , and was out in 10 minutes , as he walked by me he smiled and said , “ I knew I could get away with punching an adult ” . 	0

In six years of going into schools to talk to children , I have only been hit once . 	0
A fourth grader in the public system punched me in the back . 	0
Personally i ' d go co-ed . 	1
A teenager – an outcast – armed with a gun – walked into the school cafeteria . 	0
In a matter of moments , five students were gunned down . 	0
As someone who went to a same sex school for 8 years , I found it lacked the diversity you get in a co-ed environment . 	0
Parent-Teacher conferences were set for Thursday . 	0

There is a time and a place for everything , including religion . 	0
I am not sure if this is already the case , but I believe that it would serve the State well to treat homeschooling as a type of private school and require that they meet the same standards as those registered facilities . 	0
I am involved as a parent , why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system . 	0
There ' s no doubt boys behave a little different when girls are watching , and i also found boys were quite good at limiting the bitchyness girls are renowned for . 	0
Some parents may see this as an invasion of their privacy and an intrusion , but the State has a responsibility to ensure that all children living in this country are properly educated . 	0
So both kept one another in line , and made for a more positive and dynamic environment . 	0
I also think there ' s a few extra life lessons and skills children can learn at co ed schools . 	0
Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance . 	0
Really I ' m bad because I want my daughter to know Christ . 	0
Dating , relationships , interacting with the opposite sex , i think children at co ed schools tend to have a far better grasp of these skills then students who ' ve only attended same sex schools . 	0
So what makes your average mom or dad think they can do my job with no degree and no experience ? 	0
The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children ' s education is taking place . 	0
Public School is not the place for religion , unless we are doing a Comparative Religions course , in which all views are examined . 	1
Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the " Reform Period " by going private . 	0
I was a product of the public school system , and yes , they are very necessary . 	0
Secondly , banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy , as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply . 	0
That in itself clearly does not transform schools into “ God-free zones ” ; banning schools from leading prayers , like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments , merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments , for students of every religion or no religion . 	0
For proof of this , all one need do is to recall the 2006 shooting spree which occurred in an Amish school in Pennsylvania . 	0
Officially implementing mandatory school prayers in no way offers a divine guarantee against school shootings from occurring . 	0
And this tragedy occurred despite the fact that community-based Amish schools ( which are not public schools ) conduct morning Bible readings and daily prayers . 	0
Or you could stop being so selfish to the child and send it out into the world so it can learn the importance of society and how to ineract with it . . . an education is often only useful if you know how to work with people using it . 	0
I ' m sure you are , but there are plenty that aren ' t . 	0
what like making sure you are fit to teach a child responsibly . . 	0
The girls in my year just had entirely different interests . 	0
In terms of results ; I really think it ' s mostly up to the individual and how driven they are , coupled together with a good teacher , as to whether or not they do well . 	0
Most of the people I have spoken to who have attended an all-girls school would have chosen to go co-ed had they been given another chance . 	0
I myself went to a co-ed , and am so glad I was able to – I only had a few close female friends , because I was way more comfortable hanging out with the boys – I just preferred playing sport during breaks than gossiping about what happened over the weekend . 	0
But there is also a case to be made for parents who wish to home-school their children . 	1
We in Barbados think of homeschooling as an activity that occurs only in North American countries or perhaps further afield , and cannot imagine why in a country that offers free education to all school aged children , a parent would want to take on the responsibility of teaching their child . 	0
The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more . 	0
I am all for the public school system . 	1
It is a question I used to ask myself some years ago , until I recognised that the school environment of today is much more explosive than it was just a few decades ago . 	0
I would respectfully recommend you actually take the time to learn about home-schooling before posting such ignorant and hateful words but alas , the products of a liberal and intolerant educational system cannot possibly fathom such a possibility . 	0
Ah yes , the shining examples of the ignorance of home-schooling is well displayed in the majority of these posts . 	0
A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned . 	0
This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment . 	0
In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women . 	0
They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people . 	0
In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals . 	0
It will no doubt require that officials of the Ministry of Education create measures to guide parents opting to go this route , and by extension require them to visit these homes to observe what is being done . 	0
One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people . 	0
I regard single sex education as bad . 	1
“ It ’ s the isolation that allows it to exist . " 	0
One friend of mine , a product of a girl ' s high school , had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course . 	0
My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do . 	0
So if we add Friday to the weekend , then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday , and not have to choose between going to school , or going to worship . 	0
It ’ s simple ! 	0
Now , there are pros and cons for each . 	0
But I feel that the co-ed school is more " natural " and its pros outweigh its cons more than the all-girls school . 	0
Otherwise , any discussion of religion should be strictly technical . 	0
I switched to an all-girls school in the 10th grade and stayed until I finished high school . 	0
First of all , those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes . 	0
I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos . 	0
Schools are not always bad because of funding etc . Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers . 	0
Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification . 	0
They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students , when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge . 	0
But there ' s always going to be a difference of maturity between different individuals , whether male or female . 	0
My father continues to deny my condition to this day and like many disabled children in mainstream schools I was bullied . 	0
Girls are more mature than boys generally , yes . 	0
And personally , I was always more mature than most of the other girls , too . 	0
Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God , I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school . 	1
Ask your daughters what they would prefer . . . Btw , I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine . 	0
Her year went really well too . 	0
And on and on . 	0
Girls do calming exercises ; boys run . 	0
It has a way of sharpening the mind . 	0
That ’ s likely to be good for all of us , regardless of gender . 	0
Hearing yourself say some of this gobbledygook aloud to your kids , though ? 	0
It is closer to the ' real world ' that way . 	0
I went to an all boys school – Can ' t say I particularly liked it , I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed . 	1
They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense . 	0
Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes . . . 	0
We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools . . . 	0
If it is purely education you are concerned about ( and not so much behaviour ) , our year ( at a private school ) went shockingly bad in OP scores . 	0
In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school . 	0
So you can never tell . 	0
We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him . 	0
I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now . 	0
We are making it work and I can tell you , that I have seen a 100% difference in him . 	0
He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids . 	0
At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually . 	0
Some view much of what as taught as " secularism . " 	0
But none of this is praying to Darwin , or claiming him , or anything , a deity . 	0
This is a sticky subject . 	0
Some think of evolution as teaching atheism . 	0
If they wish to raise their children as atheists , that is their right no matter what anyone thinks . 	0
So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith , no matter how shallow , on them ? 	0
Please look forif you ' re interested . 	0
A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent ' s right to raise their children . 	0
Wow . 	0
This brings up a related topic about children ' s rights . 	0
There are serious problems in our public schools . 	0
Morals can only be built on the basis that a moral source-God-exists . 	0
Once acknowledgement of God ' s existence is removed , there is no absolute basis for morals , and a free society drifts toward anarchy . 	0
Young Mr . Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling . 	0
Then its badness is just something you deplore in the abstract . 	0
Since prayer was removed from public school classrooms in 1962 , we have had a six-fold increase in violent crime , our divorce rate has tripled , births to single mothers have increased five-fold , the teenage suicide rate has tripled , and SAT scores ( standardized college entrance test ) have dropped 80 points ( approximately 10% ) . 	0
No matter how well intentioned , few parents have the education , time , and skills needed to teach . 	0
Parents have all the years before the kids start school in which to indoctrinate litt 	0
When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me , would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school ? 	0
Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools , demanding better performance and . 	0
outcome and be willing to support the much needed funding . 	0
Independent schools have much greater freedom to follow other educational philosophies and practices - Montessori , Steiner , small alternative schools and Summerhill being particularly noteworthy . 	0
But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion . 	0
I feel my education was a perfect balance . 	0
The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch , dug by those who despise authority ( Nobody tells me what to do ) , see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow , behind every bush , and in anything that will require them to think before they vote . 	0
Befuddled wishful thinking rules . 	0
Imo it ' s not healthy for anyone . 	0
Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24 / 7 . 	0
I simply don ' t have the desire or patience to be THAT present . 	0
I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool . 	1
As Britain becomes more secular , it becomes increasingly ridiculous that outdated laws like that of collective worship stay on the books . 	0
They have lots of great adults in their lives . 	0
I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am " everything " for my kids 24 / 7 . 	0
It ' s important to remember too that private schools are neither required to hire certified teachers nor administer state tests . 	0
They also have wide latitude in deciding which students to admit and which to push out . 	0
The national average of public schools is pulled down by the number of such schools serving poor students . 	0
If these schools were eliminated , schools in the affluent suburbs would hold their own against the best private schools . 	0
But achievement is higher because students in private schools come from more affluent families than students in public schools , rather than because of better practices . 	0
This distinction is crucial . 	0
Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Sarah and Christopher Lubienski , professors at the University of Illinois , found that when controlling for demographic factors , public schools are doing a better job academically than private schools . 	0
The parents can talk to their kids about evolution and explain that they do not believe that evolution ever happened ; they can try to push the creation theory and see where they end up . 	0
At a time when public schools are the target of unrelenting criticism , the results of a new study come as welcome news ( " Are Private Schools Worth It ? " 	0
The Atlantic , Oct . 18 ) . 	0
But don ' t assume that one size fits everybody , because it doesn ' t . 	1
If you really enjoyed school , good for you . 	0
Each to his own , as I said . 	0
I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard . 	0
I feel strongly that I had a very good education , but my husband said his was lacking . 	0
Neither of us knows much about private education from personal experience , however both of us have met privately-schooled people at university and through work . 	0
These people have spoken about opportunities , like sport and music programs , that had not been available to us as public students , and the extra resources available at the private schools because there was more money available . 	0
The media is full of reports on the lack of funding for public education , and the number of teachers compared with students in the public system means classes are bigger than we ’ d like . 	0
But for a complete , general education do private schools offer the range of subjects , experiences and environment public schools do ? 	0
From my school experience , public schools offered more diversity socially , spiritually and ethnically , so I think it provided a more realistic view of the world I would face after school . 	0
If officials at your school have questions about the event , share our letter with them . 	0
To help these students , we have prepared a letter explaining students ’ well-established legal right to engage in prayer and worship at See You at the Pole and to promote the event at school . 	0
An impotent prayer is no threat to anyone . 	0
If you honestly think your kids will be permanently damaged by learning about evolution , get a grip . 	0
But an effective prayer to a God who hears … well , I guess some might find that a little threatening . " 	0
I am not one who needs others to make the choices I made to feel better about myself . 	0
And it ’ s not even the superior academics . 	0
Full disclosure : my wife and I homeschooled our four children through eighth grade , and then used a mixture of private Christian high school and additional homeschooling throughout their high school years . 	0
But that ’ s not what drives this for me . 	0
And want one more fact that may surprise you ? 	0
Homeschooled children do not lag behind public school children overall in communication and socialization skills . 	0
Homeschooled children ’ s tests scores were not significantly affected by their parents ’ household incomes or whether their parents were certified teachers . 	0
Homeschooled children perform better overall in college — from their freshman years to their senior years . 	0
So why am I such an advocate ? 	0
Because homeschooling is what lets you guard and protect your child ’ s heart and optimally mold their character in a dark and fallen world . 	0
Trust me , I know . 	0
First hand . 	0
Learn what ? 	0
The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us ? 	0
Isherwood Yes , that ' s true , but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts , pray , do homework for the class at hand , etc . Sorry , I can ' t quote the source , but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence ( not necessarily religiously related silence and / or prayer , just silence ) do much better in school because people don ' t realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought . 	0
I don ' t think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it ' s current decrepit state . 	0
It ' s all good . 	0
Don ' t worry , I agree . 	0
They are still usually better than parents who have other things to do and who ignore the daily chore of teaching their kids schoolwork . 	0
I attended private school up until age 14 , and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed . system . 	0
True , but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong . 	0
His father , Clarence Powell , defends the home-school education that Josh and his 11 siblings have received , and that he has a right to educate his children any way he sees fit without the government interfering . 	0
He eventually took remedial classes at a community college and has since transferred to Georgetown University , but he still has a long way to go in catching up on the years of missed education . 	0
When they declined , he petitioned the school system to let him in , but they declined too . 	0
Powell himself realized how far behind he was falling and had asked his parents to send him to school . 	0
One of his siblings , currently at middle school age , still hasn ' t learned to read . 	0
Powell tells of how his parents , who kept him and his 11 younger siblings out of public schools for religious reasons , failed to provide a basic education that left him far behind other children his age in areas like math , science , history , and English . 	0
The article profiles 21-year-old Josh Powell , the product of home schooling in rural Virginia , who paints an incredibly negative picture of the experience of getting your education at home . 	0
Why do some parents not think their kids can attain ? 	0
No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his / her will , but I ' m all in favor of voluntary selection into one . 	0
I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor . 	1
The Powells , of course , are just on case of a home-schooling family , but Josh thinks they are other kids like him . 	0
The example one of them gave was , " My neighbor held back her child , and now she ' s in first grade , and reading at a 4th grade level ! " 	0
Not only that , but far from the crisis in public education that many see , the Lubienskis make a strong case that public school are doing a fine job educating the youth of America . 	0
The results of the study don ’ t surprise me because I live in the real world , and in the real world the best get paid the most . 	0
According to Atlantic , the Lubienskis report that the Educational Testing Service , Stanford and Notre Dame all took a look at the same statistics — datasets they call it — and came to the same conclusions . 	0
The Lubienskis aren ’ t saying that public school students score higher , because test comparisons show that the average private school student scores higher . 	0
But the private school student is likely to be wealthier , come from a stable family , not have a disability and not have suffered early life trauma . 	0
Correct for these factors — in a sense only compare apples that fell from the private school tree with those that fell from the public school tree — and the public school wins hands down . 	0
It doesn ’ t surprise me that somebody figured out how to prove that public schools outperform private schools . 	1
And it doesn ’ t surprise me that this seminal study is being ignored by the mainstream news media . 	0
As of one day after Atlantic released its article reviewing The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools , a Google search yielded but one article covering the important findings of authors Sarah Theule Lubienski and Christopher A Lubienski . 	0
The Lubienskis took into the account the effects of affluence , disabilities and other background factors and found that then public schools outperformed private schools over the past twenty years . 	0
I don ' t think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports . 	0
The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students . 	0
Around here , there are plenty of choices , but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools . 	0
I don ' t see the big deal . 	1
I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children . 	0
Interestingly , it wasn ' t the atheist Madalyn Murray O ' Hair who sued the school district to stop this , it was some Jewish parents , who thought that the prayers said in school would not be considered appropriate for Jewish students to pray . 	0
Let us hope they do not break the broad global consensus on education reform by pursuing ideological distractions that threaten to undermine the right to education . 	0
For many years the DFID has been a global leader in supporting sector-wide public education reform through the Global Partnership for Education . 	0
Lost revenues from tax exemptions given away unnecessarily by governments add up to $138 billion annually- which is more than enough to ensure we deliver on the full education and wider development agenda in every country . 	0
We need to support progressive macro-economic policies over austerity and we urgently need to expand the domestic tax base of low income countries , for example by ending the unnecessary and often corrupt tax holidays given to big multinational companies . 	0
We need to mobilise new resourcing for education , securing at least 6% of GDP and 20% of national budgets . 	0
We desperately need to improve the quality of public schools , and this issue needs concerted attention and support . 	0
Thankfully , most DFID funding for education is still spent on such efforts . 	0
Such investments yield systemic , nation-wide returns in improving quality – a much more strategic and effective use of public money . 	0
Ideological reasons for homeschooling are , in my opinion , completely legitimate . 	0
The public education system has not failed , it ' s got to deal with things that no private school does . 	0
Most private schools are nothing more than religious indoctrination , what difference does it make ? 	0
If you put the same restrictions on the private schools , they ' d be just as bad . 	0
America has experienced radical decline in each of the four areas which the children ’ s prayer touched upon : youth , family , education , national life . 	0
The New York school children which prompted the Engel vs . Vitale ruling had simply prayed : “ Almighty God , we acknowledge our dependence on Thee and beg Thy blessing over us , our parents , our teachers and our nation . ” 	0
The removal of prayer from our schools was a violation of the third commandment which commands us “ not to take the name of the Lord in vain . ” 	0
Minor recovery has occurred only since 1980 when the election of President Reagan brought forth a renewed emphasis on “ traditional ” values . 	0
Consider the following chart compiled from his study , America : To Pray or Not to Pray . 	0
A recent statistical analysis by David Barton graphically illustrates how America has plummeted from righteous living , prosperity and success in the last quarter century . 	0
On June 25 , l962 , 39 million students were forbidden to do what they and their predecessors had been doing since the founding of our nation – publicly calling upon the name of the Lord at the beginning of each school day . 	0
1 As you might have already noticed on Mr . Barton ’ s graph , America ’ s moral decline rapidly accelerated following one event – the U . S . Supreme Court ’ s removal of prayer from our nation ’ s schools . 	0
Worse than taking the Lord ’ s sacred name in vain is treating it with contempt , denying it rightful place and stripping it from public use and even from the lips of children . 	0
By the judicial act of forbidding invocation , the Court audaciously elevated a secularized system of education beyond the authority , reach and blessing of God Himself . 	0
Each school district is different . 	0
Each classroom environment is different . 	0
Each child is an individual . 	0
I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life . 	0
That February birthday excuses me from much of this anxiety . 	0
I think the social aspect of co-education outweighs the potential distractions ; at the end of 6 years , you come out with a study score , but once you have that , I think the memories and friendships you got out of those 6 years become much more important , and I can ' t imagine having as good an experience had I gone to an all-girls school . 	0
While a public school classroom is perfect for your 11-year old Johnnie , it might not be right for 9-year old Susie . 	0
While a particular school district worked well for your kids , perhaps moving to a new school district found them to not be so cooperative . 	0
Given the research on the topic , if you have concerns about your child ’ s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them , this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention , if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling . 	0
So what is the answer to the question originally asked of me at that cocktail party ? 	0
What will I do for Leo ? 	0
Well , he will be 5 1 / 2 at the time of kindergarten . 	0
Although I am a big fan of examining the data to inform parenting , the results often do not reveal a clear path , and although group level statistics are useful , they do not tell parents what their individual child ’ s trajectory will be . 	0
What is clear , however , is that given redshirting is much less common than originally thought , parents should worry less about how their child ’ s age will compare to peers ( there is no reason to hold them back just so they won ’ t be much younger than most of their peers ) and more about the signals their own children are giving them . 	0
The big areas to consider are : social skills ( ability to initiate and maintain play , sharing , understanding of own and others ’ emotions ) , academic skills ( knowledge of content areas such as letter / number recognition and phonics ) , ability to regulate impulses ( staying on task , following directions ) , and fine motor skills ( fine motor skills have been linked with academic success above and beyond content knowledge and attentional abilities ) . 	0
Interestingly , teachers rate enthusiasm to learn , ability to follow directions , and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success , less so than actual academic knowledge ( which parents tend to perceive as most important ) . 	0
Send your kids to school with their kids . 	0
Do something about it . 	0
Use your connections to power and money and innovation to make your local school—the one you are now sending your child to—better . 	0
Use the energy you have otherwise directed at fighting to get your daughter a slot at the competitive private school to fight for more computers at the public school . 	0
Don ’ t just acknowledge your liberal guilt—listen to it . 	0
Single sex education has been very good for girls , especially . 	1
Look at the women leaders in this country and you will find that they are products of single sex educational institutions . 	0
That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God . 	0
It is opposed because it represents the antithesis to the beliefs of those who set policy for much of our public school system . 	0
My kids won ' t go to public schools for a lot of reasons . 	0
I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do . 	0
Values can be promoted , in accordance with the client population ' s choice . 	0
Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly . 	0
Ms Wong is really the bad person here , because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys ' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students . 	0
We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools , especially in the contemporary religious environment . 	0
That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to . 	0
Prayer is an action which proclaims that life is more than saving the environment or accumulating wealth . 	0
If the textbooks contain any reference to God , there ' s trouble , and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God , or religion . . or the hereafter . . or what ever may have any religious connotation , the children tell their parents and the parents complain ! ! ! ! 	0
Time was , the school day started with a prayer , and yes , maybe religion classes , but not nowadays . . there would be full scale war . 	0
The movement to single-sex education in the US has been framed as a solution to both girls ’ absence from science , technology , engineering , and math disciplines and the perceived decline in boys ’ overall academic success . 	0
However , the data behind these assertions is shaky at best . 	0
Diane Halpern , Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association , wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature . 	0
Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing , the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades . 	0
More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms . 	0
An important question that arises in consideration of public schooling , though , is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students . 	0
Where ever the Muslims go , they expect " special " treatment . 	0
Ohhhh , here we go again ! ! ! ! 	0
In order to keep everyone satisfied , there should be no religion in schools . 	1
No religion in schools . . . . this is what we ' ve come to . 	1
Too bad , if the Muslim children don ' t come back to classes after their prayers . 	0
If parents want their children to have religion , they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship . 	0
For goodness sake , it ' s just awful . 	0
That ' s their problem , not the school ' s . 	0
To this day , I tend to feel uncomfortable around anyone who doesn ' t fit that criteria ( ironically enough , since I ' m a left-winged , pansexual atheist ) . 	0
No one is being forced to participate in the event , nor is it interfering with class time . 	0
Yes , they socialize with other people - but those people are other white , right-winged , heterosexual Christians . 	0
So what is the threat ? 	0
They just don ' t get it . 	0
They just don ' t understand the world . 	0
And , that starts with a high quality , fair education that focuses on techniques that work and teaches all students as individuals , not as stereotypes . 	0
There were not a lot of choices as far as curriculum and very few parents continued to homeschool through high school . 	0
I don ' t think that home schooling is good for children and I don ' t think that single sex schooling is good for children either . 	1
On September 25th , millions of students across the globe will participate in See You at the Pole by joining together before the beginning of the school day to pray for their friends , families , teachers , school , and nations . 	0
Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually , I can ' t think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids . 	0
Prepared to be proved wrong though . . . . 	0
Interesting . 	0
I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons . 	0
I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would . 	0
I can ' t help wondering , though , what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids . 	0
What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision . 	0
None of us are perfect . 	0
That said , should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack . 	0
There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required . 	0
But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels . 	0
Firstly , we have not “ kicked God out of our schools . ” 	0
Students can ( and do ) . 	0
In the wake of violent school-related tragedies , such as the recent massacre at a Newtown , Connecticut public elementary school , there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not “ kicked God out of our schools ” by banning state-led school prayer . 	0
So , schools are by no means “ prayer free zones ” — the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned , teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding . 	0
Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own , throughout the day , at school . 	0
While acting in their capacity as employees of the state , public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion . 	0
( That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms , or teach creationism in science classes , since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers . ) 	0
That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . 	0
These techniques can vary from room temperature to instruction approaches . 	0
Some educators also suggest that single-sex education can broaden the educational prospects for both the sexes . 	0
When putting these theories into practice , however , experts have asserted that separating students has consequences that extend far beyond the act of learning . 	0
Social , political , and legal concerns come into play when dealing with instituting these policies in public schools . 	0
Proponents of same-sex education argue that a mixed-gender classroom can be distracting for many students , especially at certain ages . 	0
Leonard Sax , founder of the National Association for Single-Sex Public Education , argues that while merely placing boys in separate classrooms from girls accomplishes little , single-sex education enhances student success when teachers use techniques geared toward the gender of their students . 	0
Single-sex education ( teaching males and females in separate classrooms or schools ) is an old approach to instruction that has been gaining new momentum in the education reform era . 	0
Although the practice has long existed in many private schools , it ' s a relatively new option for traditional public schools and charter schools . 	0
Now that over 500 public schools offer some form of single-sex education , experts are renewing the debate over the value of separating boys and girls in the classroom . 	0
According to recent research on the differences between males and females , there are natural differences in how boys and girls approach learning . 	0
I can learn things for myself w / little effort . 	0
But I cannot teach someone else on an educational level , especially since the techniques have changed so much from the way I learned . 	0
My boys have needed help w / their homework at times , and I am honestly dumbfounded at the processes that are used today . 	0
Aside from the fact that I just could not ensure they would get the proper education they deserve for themselves , the only other con that I can see w / homeschooling though is the socialization skills . 	0
I have to say that I admire anyone who has the patience for homeschooling . 	0
I know that I could never do it and make sure that my boys got a good enough education . 	0
Because I ' m a much better " learner " than I am a " teacher " and admittingly I just don ' t have the patience that it requires . 	0
I can teach life skills w / no problem . 	0
I know there are other ways around it , but to me , the best way for kids to learn how to interact w / their own peers is by having the opportunity to learn in an environment that isn ' t necessarily always something interest-based like sports , clubs , playgrounds , etc . but that ' s just me . 	0
I know exactly what is spent per student , the check I just wrote . 	0
They removed me from school because school / teachers were teaching me nothing other than ‘ you are thick so why bother teaching you ’ . 	0
My second son , whom graduated from MIT , received a “ Mathematics and Verbal Talent Search Award from The John Hopkins University in 1995 ; when we attended the ceremony we observed that most of the recipients of the awards were home-schooling students and had foreign last names . 	0
No everybody can teach and learn at home , and some parents and students cheat at home as well as they do at public schools , and the big problem is that nobody could catch them because the most important thing for many parents in this country is that their children should have as many “ As ” as possible on their resu 	0
From the students I taught that were home-schooling , only one was exceptional brilliant , he got a very high score in the SAT , and he attended the University of Maryland , College Park to study engineering . 	0
Also , I know that I could have home-schooling my children , because I have a very high level of education , but I would not have the patient to do that , and I believe my sons were benefited with a very good education from a very good public high school with excellent teachers in Worcester County in Maryland ; my oldest son is a biologist ( Salisbury University ) with three masters , my second son is a mathematician ( MIT ) , and my third son is a mechanical engineer ( College Park ) . 	0
It isn ’ t the same the influence that a student mind has from several teachers and their way of thinking than from only one parent way of teaching . 	0
My three sons graduated from a very good high school in Worcester County in Maryland , and the three of them attended excellent universities . 	0
( And non of the home schooling families I know did / do that either , so what a silly thing to assume that ' s why families do it ) . 	0
It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone , but the parents can ' t afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich . 	0
My parents knew I was capable of more , that I was intelligent but somehow school weren ’ t willing to see it . 	0
I wasn ’ t me that ‘ couldn ’ t be bothered to learn ’ it was the teachers who couldn ’ t be bothered to teach . 	0
Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools . 	0
How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent , " bad people " ? 	0
Our liberal , anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching . 	0
Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society . 	0
They , instead , use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles . 	0
And this author thinks we are " bad people " for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced , healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities ? 	0
The advantage of private school is simple , my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children , a top notch education . 	0
The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed , per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch . 	0
There are the rare exceptions where homeschooling is great - but for most it is child abuse . 	1
Regular testing should be required and if they fail it ' s back to public school . 	0
I have been known to crunch some granola myself and do not view this as a bad thing . 	0
Actually , after reading the comments , that is about the same percentage as my readers who choose to homeschool . 	0
While homeschooling is becoming more secular , the No . 1 reason ( 36% ) parents give for homeschooling is for religious reasons . 	0
However , one is in college and the other is going to be a junior in high school this fall , so that ship has sailed . 	0
Many parents commented that they can get through their lesson plans in just a few hours as opposed to the six hours of instruction it takes in school . 	0
Actually , I don ’ t remember any teacher I worked with ever saying a negative word about homeschooling . 	0
If you show respect to the teachers , they just might return the favor . 	0
I was rather offended at the teacher bashing . 	0
In a class of 25 this takes some time , but I believe it is a good thing for students to hear the various perspectives and express their views among their peers . 	0
This is because there is no classroom management to deal with , and there are often questions and discussion during lessons . 	0
I don ' t think that the big school model is very effective . 	0

It ' s not that I was taught that it was wrong , it was never a topic that was brought up . 	0
Lately I ' ve been thinking more seriously about my single-sex education after devouring Sheryl Sandberg ' s now infamous Lean In . 	0
One of Sandberg ' s bigger points is that a lot of work needs to be done long before women are in careers , graduate school , or even college , in order to teach them how to lean in . 	0
When people find out I ' m the product of eight years of all-girls ' schooling they often ask what the best part of the experience was . 	0
I usually answer , only half-joking , " I rarely had to shave my legs . " 	0
In Lean In Sandberg explains that as a child she used to organize all the neighborhood children and tell them what to do . 	0
But to this day she cringes when her siblings tell this story because : " When a girl tries to lead , she is often labeled bossy . 	0
Given this focus on childhood and adolescence I ' m surprised that all-girls ' schools haven ' t been discussed in the same breath as Sandberg ' s long-term project . 	0
Boys are seldom called bossy because a boy taking the role of a boss does not surprise or offend . " 	0
My professional , adult self certainly understands this sentiment , but my 13-year-old self would have been confused . 	0
But it turns out , she ’ s not the only one with this problem , and , in fact , given the rapid increase in single-sex programs in public schools , it looks like the trouble may only be spreading . 	0
Take a look at the recently-released November 2010 Arkansas Department of Education ’ s Application for School Improvement Grants . 	0
It explains that Jacksonville High School ( JHS ) initiated The Freshman Academy “ to help incoming freshmen who needed extra help with academics and social / emotional needs , ” a laudable goal . 	0
Oh come on . 	0
As a visiting student at Barnard College years ago , I attended the transfer students ’ orientation where each student was asked to explain why she had chosen Barnard . 	0
I ’ ll never forget one woman ’ s response : Well , I went to an all-girls elementary school and an all-girls middle school and an all-girls high school , and when I got to my co-ed college , I didn ’ t know how to function around the boys , so I decided to transfer to Barnard . 	0
Well , that ’ s one solution . 	0
I think I laughed at the time . 	0
Instead of using the program to meet its designated goals , JHS leadership used “ the Academy as a dual gender reassimilation because the students were coming from gender-based feeder schools . 	0
The Academy became a chance for the students to get back together after being separated in the Jacksonville Boys Middle School and the Jacksonville Girls Middle School . ” 	0
These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs , and have their education ruined by undisciplined , uncontrolable , disruptive classmates . 	0
But here ’ s the thing : sending my child to a private school does not exempt me from paying city and state taxes that help fund public schools , nor would I want it to . 	0
In an ideal world , I would be in full support of such ideas but in reality , this issue is far more complex ; embracing children with different requirements and potentials . 	0
I ' m not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she ' s not Mexican . 	0

@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science , just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s . 	0
You ' re also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators . 	0
We ' ve even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now , and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening , so you can see we ' re all quite flexible about learning . 	0
Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not . 	0

Also consider that school is about 25% efficient , so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time , you lose a fair bit in disruptions , admin , not understanding ( or not listening to ) the topic and having it explained again , finishing the exercise and waiting while it ' s explained again to someone else , etc . Home education doesn ' t take long holidays like school does , so if you work it out , the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key , low-pressure teaching all the time . 	0

In terms of fostering an educational environment which feels secure for the child , it is hard to think how the government could be less helpful . 	0
Even if granted , I would have to go through this process on an annual basis and , at any point the LEA could refuse my application and force my child into school . 	0
Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged . 	0

The government may implement these recommendations by including them in the Queen ' s speech on 18 November . 	0
This letter was prompted by my concerns about the Badman report , a review into home-education which was submitted in June and immediately accepted by Balls . 	0
Today , I received a copy of a letter that my local MP sent to the education secretary , Ed Balls . 	0
I would also have to apply to my local authority for approval which may , or may not , be granted . 	0
It would be compulsory for me to register with the local authority and a criminal offence for me not to . 	0
Badman ' s recommendations would change what home education means to us – a positive and successful part of our family life – into an ongoing battle with the state . 	0
I am not a home-education evangelist and neither do I have any problem with the concept of school , but I do know that home education works for us . 	1
Consequently , the outcome , far from being one of ‘ liberation ’ , can actually cement oppression , simply because the bigger picture hasn ’ t been considered . 	0

From my own experience , I can vouch for the truth of the previous statement . 	0
Many sociologists agree that females are , " unable to perform if they are not at least 50% of a class , they feel pressured by stereotype threat and the potential for gender bias , and so a 100% same-sex class would seem to unlock the potential for all females " ( Campbell 7 ) . 	0
And so , one can argue that a single-sex education can more accurately focus the learning needs of the targeted sex ; but does that secluded sex suffer from the lack of the opposite ? 	0
We must first come to realize that while males and females are not two different species , that are very different when it comes to learning , expression , and overall being . 	0
So , will a single-sex education make you smarter ? 	0
Nonetheless , it has been an on-going , contentious issue for society as to whether a single-sex or co-ed environment provides a superior education . 	0
Contrary to popular belief , the 500 girls that went to my school were not closeted-bible-loving-anti-social-feminists and we did , in fact , socialize with members of the opposite sex . 	0
I spent the last four years of my life in a private , catholic , all girls college preparatory high school and while one may say that I missed out on the standard , social facets of a typical high school experience ; I would argue till death that my all girls high school experience was something I wouldn ' t trade for the world . 	1
I , myself , felt more open and confident to participate in an all girls setting . 	0
I had classmates in high school that flourished in an all-girls setting , by allowing themselves to say and do things they wouldn ' t have done in the company of boys . 	0
Seems a tad delusional to me . 	0
For us , we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically , socially and physically ready . 	0
They miss the cut off by three months here , so it ' s been an issue finding a placement for them . 	0
So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade . 	0

The latter point is crucial , as parents who opt to pay have prioritised education in their households and will provide a more supportive home environment – which is a key determinant of educational success . 	0
Even if there was some marginal evidence of an increase in gain of quality , it is questionable as to whether or not this could be retained on a larger scale . 	0
Furthermore , and there is no evidence to suggest that the “ competition effect ” of low-cost private schools helps to aid in the process of put increasing pressure for improvements in the quality of public schools ( in fact , private schools do the opposite , draining and pauperising the public sector ) . 	0
The narrative surrounding the causality of any ( flawed ) claims of difference in learning outcomes tends to relate to teacher attendance and school accountability . 	0
Even private schools that charge the lowest fees will not help extend access to the 57 million children not in school today . 	0
Proponents of low-cost , private schools argue that privatised schools offer a model of higher educational quality ; but it is here that the evidence is highly contested and inconclusive . 	0
Proponents tend to be highly selective in quoting what is often flawed , and superficial research about improved learning outcomes . 	0
The biggest flaw is that most comparative studies fail to control for the socio-economic status of children as well as the self-evident motivation of parents . 	0
I believe in discipline , accountability , and excellence . 	0
After all , I have a Master of Arts in Teaching , I did my time doing internships and student teaching , and I am experienced at teaching in the classroom . 	0
The proponents of privatised education argue that private schools make a difference by ensuring that teachers are in the classroom and that schools are accountable to parents . 	0
If so , the coherent response should be to invest in teachers within the public system : expanding and improving training and support , making school inspectorates work effectively and strengthening school management committees . 	0
These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything . 	0
It would only be fair , that if we were to bring Christian Protestant prayer back into the schools that we also allow for Catholic prayer , Muslim prayer and yes , even Satanic prayer to have their place within the school system . 	0
At best , it will create a lot of grumpy students who are forced to say something that they don ’ t believe teaching them hypocrisy and that religion is just something you say . 	0
Why would a public school , a school that isn ’ t designated as a specific Christian school , bring back Christian prayer into the schools ? 	0
It made me cringe to know that us Christians were depending on government , school boards and people who don ’ t subscribe to their faith to bring back prayer into the schools . 	0
While I am a Christian , and I follow Jesus , I don ’ t believe that bringing ‘ prayer back into the schools ’ will do anything of value to our school system , our students or our city . 	1
Why would we even expect them too or be disappointed if / when they frown upon it ? 	0

This number is lowest among low income African American children ( 1% ) , presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare , and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100 , 000 or greater ( 7% ) . 	0
Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows . 	0

Some say it benefits all students ; others say it ’ s a cost-cutting trick that denies services . 	0
Some say the practice of mainstreaming students with disabilities in regular classrooms is a controversial subject . 	0
“ Friends must learn to accept one another ’ s limitations and flaws and to complement one another ’ s weaknesses by contributing their strengths , ” Adelman wrote . 	0
In a TEACH magazine article about his new book , Adelman says inclusion of students with disabilities benefits entire student bodies by teaching kids about diversity in the real world and helping them develop empathy . 	0
When I reveal that I am child psychologist to other mothers I often get one of two reactions — heightened interest followed up by stories about their kids and requests for advice , or withdrawal out of fear of judgement . 	0
The things Sam does in the book are based on the abilities of Adelman ’ s own daughter , Dev , who also has Down syndrome . 	0

My journey has not been easy by any means . 	0
Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise . 	1
Personally my move to mainstream education was the best choice as I never really struggled academically ( my disability manifests itself more often on an interpersonal level ) , although this would never have worked for me if I hadn ’ t had provision for my disability , such as a learning support assistant ( LSA ) to help me remain focused . 	1
That said my Asperger ’ s Syndrome is rather mild and what works for me may be totally unsuitable for someone else . 	0

Though the state must respect a parent ' s right to offer an education consistent with their religious beliefs , sometimes maybe a parent needs to respect the expertise of others when it comes to determining what makes a quality education . 	0
Why is it then when in our public schools we can ' t mention or refer to God in any manner ? 	0
These are just a few examples . 	0
When the President gives his State of the Union address , above his head are the words " In God We Trust " . 	0
The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states " this nation under God shall have a new freedom " , At the very top of the Washington monument are the words " praise be to God " , The inscription on the Jefferson Memorial " God who gives us life gives us liberty " . 	0

I ’ m dyslexic , at school I could barely read , but after being home schooled my GCSE ’ s were mainly A ’ s and B ’ s and I now have a degree , this would not have been possible at school . 	0
To believe ‘ one size first all ’ is clearly coming from people who have never suffered from learning difficulties themselves , from bullying , from the physically ‘ sick with dread ’ feeling one gets on the Sunday knowing that tomorrow is a school day . 	0
I am one of 4 children , my sister thrived in mainstream school , so my parents let her stay there , my two brothers went to a different school altogether , school for boys with learning difficulties and they thrived in their school . 	0
Parents should have a right to raise their children any way they wish , but when they are failing to provide even the most basic elementary skills and knowledge they are depriving their kids of a chance to succeed in life . 	0
I ’ m sick to death of it ! 	0
Since the age of 10 I ’ ve had to put up with people judging something they don ’ t understand , telling my parents that they ’ re wrong for home schooling me ( even though I could not have been happier ) , they never asked me ( the one being home schooled ) how I felt about it , if they did they still wouldn ' t have listened , they ' ve made their mind up and they are sticking with their inexperienced views . 	0
Gathered around the flagpole of their elementary , middle , and high schools , they will cry out to God for forgiveness , favor , and protection for the coming year . 	0
Yet there are many people and groups , like FFRF , that find the peaceful prayers of this gathering of Christian students to be threatening . 	0
Parents seem to think not : an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law ( that figure drops for older people , with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld ) . 	0
As Clarence Powell himself says in the Post article : “ A good education is not an option . 	0
It “ breeds divisiveness and bullying , ” and can even “ build walls between public school students who would otherwise get along . ” 	0

All our children are different so why should we teach them all in the same way / style , surly that ’ s just common sense ? 	0

I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school , for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with , resources are good , and it is hard to put into words , but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time . 	0
I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else , but I can see the public school system just isn ' t what it used to be and that ' s why I want to send her to private school . 	0
If we could afford it , I would home school and be done with the system all together . 	0
would this happen in a state school ? 	0
I doubt it , as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor . 	0
He also couldn ' t seem to learn to read . 	0
In the public school , our son was more well-adjusted with better manners and generally happier , but didn ' t receive appropriate levels of OT and ST . 	0
Our contention all along , no matter where he goes to school , is that everyone consider the whole child - not just the academic gains or his emotional well-being but the totality of our son as a person . 	0
Instead , he was given private placement in a non-public school . 	0
At his year end IEP , we pressed for appropriate services in the public school . 	0
Despite all this , he seemed happy enough with his peers in the special education classroom ; he was a bubbly , outgoing , talkative boy . 	0
They weren ' t actively mean to him - they just gave him a wide berth . 	0
He was invited to 1 birthday party of a non-disabled peer ( God bless that little girl and her parents ! ) but no other classmates with disabilities came and the other children stayed away from my son . 	0
A stark difference is the culture of the non-public school versus the public school . 	0
In the non-public school , while they have more OT and ST and he is making progress academically , he is having behavior problems . 	0

In India , for example , low-cost , private schools often pay less than one fifth of a teacher ' s salary . 	0
These low-cost private schools share a common thread in that they extract a profit from the fees received , by either employing teachers who lack training and / or qualifications , or by paying teachers much lower salaries than those earned by teachers in government schools . 	0
UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this ; instead , such schools actually exacerbate inequality . 	0
Typically teachers are given short-term contracts ; they can be hired and fired at the whim of the private provider : this has dangerous systemic effects on the status of teachers and the credibility of the teaching profession . 	0
For parents with four children , living on a dollar a day , paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income . 	0
DFID concedes that in India , “ no schools charging below $8 are able to perform well ” . 	0
DFID has found that : “ Evidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools ” , yet , it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments . 	0
In such contexts , parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school ; and usually boys are prioritised , thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities . 	0
Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse . 	0
It can ruin your child ' s whole life . 	0
Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school . 	1
There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education . 	0
In an increasingly complex , global technological society , all people need to have a basic understanding of science , technology and local and global culture , just to be able to function and make informed decisions . 	0
I don ' t see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties . 	1
If public schools are under-performing , then the public education system needs to be improved . 	0
Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster , with ignorant , uneducated , unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn . 	0
No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch . 	0
As a student , i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . 	1
Children who don ' t want to pray don ' t have to , and those who do can have their concentration to do so . 	0
As far as a moment of silence during homeroom , I say why not ? . 	0
I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray , but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want . 	0
A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray ; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words , so why make a big deal of it ? . 	0
Unfortunately , we have millions of kids and not all families have the resources to homeschool . 	0
In many underresourced schools , it ’ s the aggressive PTAs that raise the money for enrichment programs and willful parents who get in the administration ’ s face when a teacher is falling down on the job . 	0
And parents have a lot of power . 	0
If I have kids , I will probably homeschool them , because I think that homeschooling fosters real interest and excitement in issues , compared to the stressful motivators of grades and standardized testing . 	1

I went to private school in " the hood " in Los Angeles . 	0
Why ? 	0
Private school wins , no matter where you go . 	1
Granted , this should be taught at home . 	0
Children are taught , not only the mandatory curriculum , but also how to be considerate , disciplined and respectful . 	0
In the future , should I have children , they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools , K-12 , just as I was . 	0
But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you ' re teaching them at home and they ' re being supervised at all times , and they ' re getting a good education , how does that not make sense ? 	0
No self control at all . 	0
There is widespread complaint among parents that children are tested too young and too often , teaching them only to pass tests so that civil servants can compile ultimately meaningless statistics . 	0
More and more parents are choosing to home educate because the school system fails their children . 	0
Under the new regulations though , they would have the legal right to enter my home and interview my child alone in a room to " check " for signs of abuse , not because of any good reason to suspect abuse is taking place , but simply because I have chosen to home educate . 	0
The education officers who liaise with home-educators are trained teachers , not social workers , and so are not trained in the highly specialised field of child abuse . 	0
He claims that home education is the perfect cover for child abuse , but provides no evidence to support this claim . 	0
My greatest concern about Badman , though , is his suggestion throughout the report that being at home rather than with " professionals " means that the child is at a " greater risk of harm " . 	0
As with so much legislation that the government has managed to get through parliament under the emotive banner of " child welfare " , this proposed legislation peddles the idea that children can only be dealt with by professionals . 	0
This report is a solution without a problem . 	0
No , because what the report implies is that if you send your child to a school , you are less likely to be a child abuser . 	0
Will education officers also be going into schools and taking each child into a room by themselves to " check for signs of abuse " ? 	0
This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children ' s education and the union shot it down . 	0
If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it . 	1
I have many resources available to me , my classes meet all the standards to get a high school diploma , and I ' m about to start working on university applications . 	0
This particular evening ’ s crowd , however , fell into the interested camp . 	0
Go on Netflix and watch " Waiting for Superman " . 	0
Quite the eye opener . 	0
It ' s not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools . 	0
Most of the homeschoolers I knew growing up were the stereotypical Christian homeschoolers with strict parents who didn ' t do anything secular or know anything about the real world . 	0
In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher ' s union . 	0
( Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason . ) 	0
They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary . 	0
The teacher ' s union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers . 	0
One solution to the problem of how to set standards for schools that has grown increasingly popular in the U . S . is the use of private schools . 	0
It ’ s essential . 	0
I graduated and went back and got an MBA . 	0
I have my own opinions on this debate . 	0
The debate points have changed little while both homeschool and public school have changed greatly ! 	0
I hold two bachelor degrees , graduated Magna Cum Laude from a public university , and taught in the public school system . 	0
First , may I point out that I am a product of homeschool . 	0
You basically get one opportunity to do it . 	0
I accidentally unleashed a firestorm debate on Facebook by simply asking for homeschool information from my homeschooling friends . 	0
The debate between homeschool and public school has been taking place for longer than I even know . 	0
Instead of receiving said advice , I started a debate of homeschool versus public school and socialization versus the lack thereof . 	0
When I graduated , state law did not yet allow ( or perhaps had just allowed . 	0
I graduated from homeschool in November of 1994 , a semester early . 	0
Most Americans are in favor of prayer in public school because they realize that there is something to be gained from the open acknowledgement of God ' s existence . 	0
Homeschoolers , on the other hand , frequently extend their everyday classroom in real community settings and interactions . 	0
When my kids got old enough for school , I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work . 	0
Some consider public school to be an artificial setting with students being locked behind school gates characterized by forced silence , age-segregation and school bells . 	0
There is pressure for all our pupils today in school – in fact far too much and too early . 	0
We have become a very narrow exam based factory where the ‘ whole ’ person does not appear to be as important as Maths , English and Verbal Reasoning ! 	0
Everyone needs to be invested in our public schools in order for them to get better . 	0
Ditto , social justice and pastoral care . 	0
I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die . 	0
We were never formally told , we just swept it under the carpet . . . i still feel gulity for never saying " so sad for you , how can I help you now that you mum has died . " 	0
At Private schools , a food roster is started , and kids are told to reach out . . 	0
I know it may see , irrelevant , but people care more . . . for me , this is the perceived advantage of private schooling . 	0
Boys and girls going through their teens together is a far more realistic and healthy arrangement than either single sex girls school or a school where girls join the boys in sixth form . 	0
The teenage years are perhaps the most turbulent we experience and during this period growing up side by side as the norm and mixing with the opposite sex is a powerful and important life skill . 	0
Just learning and knowing how to interact with each other , feeling comfortable , going to parties and just appreciating from a boy ’ s view that girls are not some ‘ alien creature ’ not to be talked to are vital factors in helping children to adapt to society as a whole . 	0
Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools . 	0
So , how would this work exactly ? 	0
I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better . 	0
Your local school stinks and you do send your child there ? 	0
It is very costly , but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love . 	0
The moral law never alters for the noblest or the weakest ; it remains abidingly and eternally the same . ” 	0
Regardless of how the U . S . Supreme Court has ruled , we must each , as Oswald Chambers declared , realize that “ God ’ s laws are not watered down to suit anyone ; if God did that He would cease to be God . 	0
We are living witnesses that truly “ the Lord does not hold such a nation guiltless . ” 	0
If you can I would suggest Private schooling . 	1
Worked for us . 	0
I guess it depends on your child as well and the dynamics of your family ( boys / girls / both / number of kids ) . 	0
We have 2 boys and they are going to a boys only private school and we ' re thinking of sending them to a boys only High school as well . 	0
Your local school stinks but you don ’ t send your child there ? 	0
Choose Your Pace , Choose Your Subjects Your only child will have the educational freedom to choose what he wants to learn and in a pace that he finds comfortable . 	0
At the same time , the advantages of homeschooling attracted me a great deal , ” she says . 	0
I didn ’ t want to deny him that . 	0
A school is a place where my only child can be with other children . 	0
“ I wanted to be sure I was doing the right thing . 	0
Jessica , parent of an only child who wanted to homeschool her son , gathered a long list of pros and cons from her interactions with other parents who were homeschooling their children . 	0
They are reported to be performing on par with regular schoolchildren at college , universities and at work . 	0
It is estimated that there are currently two million children coming under the homeschooling program . 	0
The trend of homeschooling is indeed catching on with growth rate of 7 to 15 percent per year . 	0
Advantages Of Homeschooling Your Only Child Many parents of single children toy with the idea of homeschooling their child at least once during their child ’ s tenure at school . 	0
I will never let my kids go to public school unless the teachers can prove they can teach . 	1
what a bunch of hogwash . . . dekalb county schoold district in jacked up georgia is not worth pigs poop . . . as a matter of fact , almost all public schools in dekalb county is lower than whale dung . . . . teachers dont care . . . . I am all for Private Schools . 	1
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SUCKS . . . . . . BUNCH OF INEPT SCHOOL TEACHERS . . . . . Georgia school system really sucks poop . . . . 	1
Teachers pay should be based on performance . 	0
But that did not turn out to be the long-term problem . 	0
Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor . 	0
And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit . 	0
Kids have too much homework ; no one I know who goes to school gets enough sleep . 	0
Where there is a will there is a way . 	0
There are grants that can be available too . 	0
4 . ) 	0
You don ' t have as much busywork . 	0
Maybe for the people who live in that neighborhood , homeschooling isn ' t the better option . 	0
But I had to go to my local public school to take the PSAT and someone was getting arrested as we were leaving . 	0
Thanks , Michael Byrd 	0
But I live in a community that could be considered a little rednecked and the extremes are a little more common here . 	0
But , hey , my first year as a full time student in college was at 13 , which I ' m not anyore , but i feel like im behind because all of the General facts about things you learn in regular school , I don ' t know . 	0
I think that the superiority over one type of schooling doesn ' t exist . 	0
It all depends on the person . 	0
I went to public school and was in every club , president of some , and also was in the Student Body Presidency . 	0
Public schooling creates lots of oppurtunities to meet large groups of people . 	0
This was good for me because my type of personality is to lead people , though usually through manipulation bargains and other types of persuasion , not because im a strong leader . 	0
At the same time I signed up for homechooling so that I could launch myself into college . 	0
I ' ve never done regular homeschooling though . 	0
So I don ' t have grounds on it . 	0
Honestly , of all the groups of people to be put through " separate but equal , " gender should be the least likely . 	0
Bottom line : Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system ( see also : Obamacare ) . 	0
I ' ve known people who were HS where their parents didn ' t really teach them all that much . 	0
Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won ' t allow it . 	0
There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them . 	0
That finding will no doubt come as a surprise to those who believe private schools are intrinsically superior . 	0
The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue . 	0
Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students , private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite . 	0
Responsible homeschooling families attempt to have open and honest communication , preparing children to deal with situations as they arise . 	0
In fact , homeschooled children are often confident , adept at communicating their point of view and capable of making wise choices and responsible decisions . 	0
It ’ s innate , a brain thing . 	0
But I ’ m that way , as is his dad and his sister . 	0
Students with special needs might benefit too . 	0
However , the flexibility provided by the homeschool lifestyle may allow students to develop expertise in other areas such as nature , travel and culture , or budgeting and home management . 	0
Homeschoolers might not study the same topics as peers ' neighborhood schools . 	0
Limited Breadth of Curriculum Some proponents of formal education are concerned that homeschooled students will not receive the breadth of curriculum that children receive in school . 	0
This argument simply does not stand , as most homeschooling families do not live in isolation . 	0
Sheltering Children vs . Strengthening Families A final argument that often crops is that homeschooled children are not prepared to deal with real-world situations . 	0
Families are able to decide how broad or how channeled a child ' s curriculum should be . 	0
They may not receive services from school-based special education staff , but they can receive individualized education in the areas most relevant to their needs . 	0
With our eldest son turning four next year , my partner and I have started discussing when he will go to school - and where . 	0
The problem is the public schools are running the schools poorly . 	1
The private school parents pay for Public , schools , as well as childless parents pay . 	0
So I don ' t blame those that spend more to send their kids to private schools , 	0
The unions are their main priorty , not the child ' s education . 	0
Also , if I hear one more person talk about the lack of “ socialization ” as a reason not to homeschool , I ’ m going to erupt . 	0
So why would anyone want to take their children out of the dominant public education system of our country and attempt to homeschool them on their own ? 	0
That ’ s easy . 	0
Kids do better academically when homeschooled . 	0
I think everyone who is able should consider homeschooling their child . 	1
However , there are also a number of respected private , or independent , schools within easy driving distance , so this is something else for us to consider when planning for our sons ’ educational needs . 	0
Somebody needs to . 	0
I am sick and tired of reading diatribes against homeschooling from those who have never homeschooled , don ’ t have children , or simply have a bias against the Christian overtones related to homeschooling . 	0
It ' s time to disestablish the Church in this country , as well , and allow children to pick any religion ( or none ) in their own time , without the Government pushing them in any direction . 	1
My husband and I both attended public schools . 	0
We aren ' t interested in whether you like it or not . 	0
So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children . 	0
Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish . 	0
Very little changed with all our efforts . 	0
Reality sunk in . 	0
We put all of our effort into making the system better , joined every group , volunteered at the school and all events . 	0
Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested . 	0
I ' ve had my children in parochial school , switched to public and now a charter school . 	0
That says something about our morals or ethics if you will . 	0
Even with aides , a teacher often has to slow down and / or pause the lesson to address certain disruptive behaviors ( saw this in my dcs ' class last year , which had multiple inclusion students , some of whom were non-verbal & had daily tantrums & outbursts ) . 	0
At any rate I do have a point to make . 	0
The fact that it made the news that these two kids were honest is amazing . 	0
The store management even provided them with some sort of reward . 	0
All of this attention and a reward for doing the right thing . 	0
Obviously , I touched a nerve and found out first-hand the extent of the cohesiveness among homeschooling community . 	0
As the elder Powell says , the failure to do so can be incredibly difficult for a child to overcome . 	0
Having those distractions ( not to mention having additonal aides in the room ) can be counterproductive to other students . 	0
People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools . 	0
You don ' t need school for this , since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations . 	0
It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family . " 	0
@ Danot " There ' s a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus . 	0
Home schooling , on the other hand , promotes independence , especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much , and ban it so happily . 	0
What schools actually promote , of course , is not " social skill " but social conformity , social obedience , and social subservience to an unelected " authority " external to the family . 	0
That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do . 	0
I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves , “ You know what , when I grow up I don ’ t want to be a fireman , I want to hurt people ” . 	0
Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on . 	0
Hell not all bad people are BAD people . 	0
Not all prisoners are bad people . 	0
Not all religious folks are good people . 	0
Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything . 	0
You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids . 	0
Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work . 	0
Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe . 	0
I ' m sending them there to learn . 	0
Plus , from my own sports experience , age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman ( when I was 14 ) . 	0
She claims it makes a " huge " difference for sports . 	0
Personally , I ' m not sending my kids to school to play sports . 	0
I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn ' t ready , but what I ' m hearing a lot of in our area is parents ( particularly of boys ) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the " class leader " or the " best " in sports ( which is ridiculous IMHO ) . 	0
One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone ( apparently , she didn ' t know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known ) . 	0
In Chicago , Illinois ( USA ) , the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten . 	0
Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice . 	0
Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors ( who were 3 to 4 years older than me ) . 	0
And really , how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is " better " at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him . 	0
I ' m on the same page as FedUp . 	0
classroom teacher , who often is not special ed certified , has his / her resources & abilities stretched to try to accommodate the special needs in their class . 	0
It isn ’ t necessarily better to have kindergarten classes full of 6- and 7-year-olds . 	0
( A good example is Hope Academy in Concord , N . C . ) 	0
If you can ’ t do that , take advantage of the growing number of schools that offer a combination of homeschooling and formalized classroom experience . 	0
But because there are few voices out there promoting for it , let me make mine loud and clear . 	0
It ’ s a difficult thing to advocate for what you feel may be the best for a child without unduly demeaning the good being done in other settings . 	0
Not just for the academics , but for their protection . 	0
If you can homeschool your child through at least the middle school years , do . 	1
And that ’ s what your goal should be : parenting your child ’ s inner world . 	0
But even if there was a conflict ( there isn ’ t ) , sports don ’ t outweigh what ’ s best for your child ’ s heart . 	0
I know so many of you strive to bring Christ to bear on that setting . 	0
Please know how much I respect and value the hard work and clear calling present in the life of countless teachers and administrators in the public school system . 	0
Let us require the parents to insure those children learn the same subjects , as their age peers , in public or private schools . 	0
Let us required the children to take standardized tests . 	0
And if you experience any difficulty promoting or participating in the event , contact us . 	0
The bible says to pray in private . 	0
That , within itself , is a major problem : these children do not receive that personal contactt with other children of their own ages . 	0
The majority of home schooled children I have met , and had contact with , are smart and get along well with adults , but have an awful time relating to other children . 	0
Happily , some parents realize this , and have their children participate in other groups , such as church , Scouting , 4H , etc . to get that additional group support , and friendships amongst their peers . 	0
They simply do not learn to interact with their peers , and thus are constrained by that pressure , the rest of their lives . 	0
The parents , described in this article , are doing their children a disservice by refusisng to not only let them , but require them to have that knowledge , required in todays workplace . 	0
This is an important part of education , and goes along with the actual learning skills and knowledge required of todays citizen , in order to further their education , get a job and advance through life . 	0
This state needs to immediately back off on the present rules , and fix the problem . 	0
They have robbed them of the chance to advance in life , and that is child abuse . 	0
We do have a lot of private schools around us , we are starting to look into the cost , as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it . 	0
Early formal education , adult-led activities , single age classes , each child across the country pretty much studying the same thing , in the same way at the same time irrespective of ability , interest or other opportunities . 	0
Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things , but I am quite concerned that God might be . 	0
Private schools do not receive money from the federal or state governments , so they have significantly more freedom in the types of courses to offer , the types of teachers they hire , and the requirements for graduation . 	0
If you can afford private school ( even if affording means scrimping and saving , or taking out loans ) , chances are that your spawn will be perfectly fine at a crappy public school . 	0
Inclusion can be successful & rewarding for all involved but it also has drawbacks . 	0
It ' s ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues , to not want " In God We Trust " on our money , and to not want " One nation under God " in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven ' t earned that claim . 	0
Cut down on the ( misogynistic ) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won ' t be any perceived " need " for single-gender classrooms . 	1
Seriously , our society depends on us interacting with each , at the very least , since we each make up over half the damn species ! 	0
In light of that fact , there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools : 1 ) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism , or 2 ) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are " better " than their public counterparts . 	0
So , my high school diploma is a GED which I passed with flying colors and had my choice of colleges to attend . 	0
There is no partnership between the parents and the teachers and as a result , there is a tendancy for the parents to side ( usually unfairly ) with their kids . 	0
Unless you are actively involved with the ongoing education of your children , helping to shape their character and working with them to develop themselves into positive , constructive members of society , then you will wind up with what we are seeing . 	0
The main problem with public schools is parent participation . 	0
What you see is 10% of the parents being involved and the rest of them expect the school system to take care of their kids . 	0
People do not send their kids so they can associate with rich kids , they send them because they know the expectations are higher and that their kids will have a chance at a better education because of it . 	0
A school system that is struggling , against the odds to somehow , marginally educate our children . 	0
There ' s nothing wrong with private schools . 	1
I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten . 	0
DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS . 	0
He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it . 	0
He was very good at sports though , even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team . 	0
I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4 . 	0
Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st . 	0
DS ' s birthday is August 30th . 	0
I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone . 	0
Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle , he would struggle regardless of when he started school . 	0
I do not compare my children with other people ' s children . 	0
What appears at first glimpse to be good progress might not be , according to psychotherapist Melinda Clayton , who practices in Florida and Colorado . 	0
A study released last August showed that the New York City Department of Education is making good progress toward reforms that will reverse a longstanding practice of segregating special education students in their own classrooms and schools , the New York Times reported . 	0
Ours will be that the State Education system is totally ruined , due to many years of being systematically abused by left-wingers . 	0
I wouldn ' t trust a state school to train a dog , much less raise a child . 	1
Should schools be forcing children to worship anyway ? 	0
I was merely soliciting information from them to add to our decision making process . 	0
For the majority of the children in the school , mainstream would not have been a suitable placement . 	1
Many didn ' t speak at all , had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting . 	0
As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available . 	0
I am a teacher ( currently SAHM ) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD . 	0
In some cases , inclusion can work fantastically well . 	1
My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school . 	0
Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources . 	0
No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it ' s a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN . 	0
The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom , but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class ( with a known teaching assistant ) . 	0
They usually went in for sessions like Art , where the difference in ability is less obvious . 	0
Public school are just as good really , if you find the good ones out of the lot that is - In CT they are recognizable 	1
Every one does not have to pray if you choose not to then that is your choice . 	0
Me being a young teen in school , have witnessed first hand to this and i can truly say that prayer should be allowed in schools . 	1
Not only has it affected the schools it has also affected the homes and the homes and its inhabitants . 	0
I believe that prayer being banned from the public school systems was by far the most uneducated and most of all immoral thing that could have been done . 	1
The United States , a far more religious place than this nation of lost souls , has enshrined that idea in its constitution : the state must not support or endorse any religion , so that people can be free to choose their own without coercion . 	0
But more important than that , imposing a state-sponsored religion is wrong . 	1
Please don ’ t let the ignorance of 10 people ruin a nations well being ! ! ! 	0
Increasingly , girls have been besting boys ’ performance across the board : G . P . A . s , school leadership , graduation rates , college attendance . 	0
No organized prayers or services anywhere on public school board property - FOR ANYONE . 	1
In those cases , children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it . 	0
I went to co-ed schools from kindergarten until the end of 9th grade . 	0
I will have 10 special education students in one class period , and another math teacher with the same class in the same period will have none . 	0
I have ADHD and really struggled with the classroom setting- I had too much energy to stay in my seat , I was making too much noise , I was disturbing the other kids , etc- and because of that I spent virtually all of elementary school on behavior contracts that to this day still fill me with an acute sense of shame . 	0
In middle school , I was severely bullied and isolated . 	0
That led to the development of various mental illnesses in ninth grade , and between that and the ADHD , I couldn ' t handle public school anymore and switched out . 	0
I had some great teachers , I had good grades , and I had a small handful of friends , but ultimately public school did not work for me . 	0
The success of homeschooling depends so much on the student , the parent , and the environment they live in . 	0
I did ten and a half years of public school , and then switched out halfway through ninth grade to homeschool . 	0
I now do online school and I think it works fairly well for me . 	0
Yes , I succeeded in school and was generally an A student , but that was mostly because I ' m naturally intelligent and capable . 	0
Yes , I face social barriers now , but honestly I ' m just as awkward as I was in public school . 	0
I have trouble with self motivation sometimes , and take lots of breaks , but I always get all of my schoolwork done . 	0
And the same goes for any child in any school , as any teacher will tell you . 	0
Frankly , the difference is in the parenting and input , not in the method of education . 	0
Homeschooling is not something I have a problem with . 	1
Same with the daughter . 	0
If he likes it , he ' ll stay , if he doesn ' t like it , he ' ll stay and i ' ll work with the school to sort the problems , if he still doesn ' t get on , i ' ll homeschool . 	0
As a secondary teacher who is currently a SAHM with two kids under 4 , I ' ve applied for my sons ' primary place next year . 	0
60 % of them were homeschooled badly , were not up to speed , had evidently not done much mixing , and the kids themselves struggled to fit in at all for the first few years and did not do as well academically . 	0
They went on to do very well . 	0
40% of them were fantastic and had obviously had superb parenting and a grounded education with lots of input from a variety of educators and people . 	0
However , I have taughth some children who have been homeschooled up to Secondary level . 	0
St . Clair high school would once again have both good and bad consequences because boys would most likely do better because of the presence of girls , but girls would most likely do worse . 	0
If De La Salle had teachers capable of punishing students and keeping the boys on track while in school , then it would most likely be a benefit , if the staff lacks the ability to control the boys , it would be bad . 	0
It breaks my heart when I hear about other teachers ridiculing these students in class or dismissing their needs . 	0
I do know one family over-sheltered homeschoolers who fit the stereotypes ; and I know some AWESOME , WONDERFUL people who go to public school . 	0
Healthy , wonderful people can come out of any education ; same for unhealthy people . 	0
There are such things as homeschool groups , and we get together just for the purpose of socializing . 	0
I have so many AMAZING friends now from homeschool events . 	0
There are exceptions to this , but this is true for the MAJORITY of homeschoolers : you get healthier socialization ! 	0
5 . ) 	0
I could go on forever , but I won ' t . 	0
So those are my main points . 	0
I would think it weird to talk to someone in another grade back at school , but I have friends I can honestly call BFFs ranging from age 11-23 . 	0
Plus , you ' re exposed to a wider age range when you ' re homeschooled . 	0
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans . 	0
The debate around single sex versus co-educational ( co-ed ) will always be a controversial one . 	0
That ' s nice I suppose . 	0
Everyone interested in education will have their opinion and although data would indicate that single sex girls ’ schools might produce the best results , it would seem to be that there is more to this debate than just academic results . 	0
This is the reality of public education today . 	0
I have experience working in all boys ’ schools and co-eds and although I have not worked in a single sex girls ’ school , I strongly believe that the most important factor in all this is the school itself . 	0
I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b / c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 … . 	0
I didn ’ t debate and didn ’ t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what ? 	0
Around third grade , everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes . 	0
While history suggests boys are stronger at Maths and Science and girls are more linguistic , I believe this gender divide can be bridged by an educational framework which is inspiring and uses a range of teaching strategies . 	0
I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents . 	0
We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b / c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument . 	0
I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious ! 	0

I have seen this first hand as both a teacher and through lesson observations , as the Headteacher of North Bridge House School , it is the more social dynamic side to fully integrated co-eds that I believe to be so important . 	0
The issue of home schooling is one that always seems to spark a fierce debate , and a story published yesterday by the Washington Post is only likely to add fuel to the fire . 	0
Play , which is really a child ’ s ‘ work , ’ contributes to cognitive , physical , social , and emotional growth . 	0

The father doesn ' t appear very well educated since he doesn ' t seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort . 	0
No religious activities in schools . 	1
If there ' s a demand for single-sex schools , those should be an option available to families . 	0
The best way to respect all religions is to show favoritism to none . 	0
“ Standardized tests and other pressures have changed the trajectory of elementary education . 	0
It is a totally deteriorated system , it needs to be torn down and start over with the same kind of private education that made this country great in the first place . 	0
Too many liberals who have been indoctrinated by public universities that have no standards of right and wrong or decent and immoral . 	0
Tried hard to change the public system . 	0
That ’ s the practice of not starting a child in kindergarten until after his or her sixth birthday . 	0
A 60 Minutes segment this week focused on “ redshirting . ” 	0
The segment has generated a lot of conversation both online and in neighborhoods and preschools . 	0
It isn ’ t because of school-district rules , but is something that parents do to give their child an advantage from kindergarten and beyond . 	0
As the mom of a boy with an August birthday and a September 1 cutoff in our school system , I was torn about the potential advantages of an extra year of preschool . 	0
Including the one my kids attend . 	0
I had the opportunity to discuss this issue with Ann Densmore , EdD , an expert in language and social communication skills in children and co-author of Your Successful Preschooler . 	0
( My husband was not . ) 	0
And believe me it has been an adjustment . 	0
Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care . 	0
The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price . 	0
Up until now we were able to afford it , but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision . 	0
Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices . 	0
In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas , and she is actually graded , and not passed along if she can just get by . 	0
Wow ! ! ! 	0
If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation . 	1
He likes it and seems excited by the prospect of being a big kid in school . 	0
* He knows a lot of the kids who will start kindergarten with him ( thanks to preschool ) . 	0
I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher . 	0
* He is familiar with the elementary school , a benefit of having an older sibling . 	0
For example , Ryan recently tried to help a friend at school and the friend ( politely , kindly , rightfully ) declined Ryan ’ s help . 	0
Ryan ’ s feelings were hurt so he hit his friend . 	0
The question mark is his maturity . 	0
He can be impulsive . 	0
Girls like reading ; boys don ’ t . 	0
Not just lip-service investment , or property tax investment , but real flesh-and-blood-offspring investment . 	0
I think my view differs from my gal pals because I was able to leave and see the other side . 	0
She reiterated the fact that it all does depend on the person . 	0
And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn ' t speak for herself . 	0
Often , those who do well academically / behaviorally are often left on their own unless a parent continually advocates for their dcs in order to ensure that things are done to help them reach their full potential . 	0
As wonderful as it is that students want to help take care of the inclusion students , calming down another student means that the child doing that is taking time away from his / her own learning , not the mention the initial distraction that the outburst created . 	0
The primary responsibility of the education of a child rests on the parents . 	0
This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as I want to help all of my students , but can ' t provide the one-on-one time that my students need during class time . 	0
They went to school with them . 	0
They grew up with them . 	0
The point that I am trying to make here is that special education students already have a learning curve , so to speak , and we as teachers need to do everything we can to assist them . 	0
. 	0
My belief is preschool , kindergarten and even 1st grade should be exciting and fun so kids associate those qualities with learning . 	0
Another thing that I feel parents should be aware of : I personally found that girls who attend all-girls school will go out more to actually meet boys than girls in co-ed schools . 	0
What I mean by this is , girls in co-ed schools will hang out with boys from school ( inside and outside of school ) , yes , but the fact is : they know these boys . 	0
But that ' s just my opinion . 	0
Special education teachers see this and place more students in my classes than in other math teachers ' classes . 	0
I know that seems like such a minor gripe , but trust me , you don ' t want to be surrounded by the bullshit girls can concoct amongst each other when there are no boys to " restrict " certain behaviours . 	0
Whether they can write their names in kindergarten is not the point . 	0
Students can pray all they want together or by themselves , and very few people actually argue against this , at least I think . 	0
Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official ( who is a gov ' t official if we are talking about public schools ) . 	1
I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer , or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , for that matter . 	0
If teachers aren ' t willing to step up to the challenge , they shouldn ' t enter the teaching profession in the first place . 	0
Seriously . 	0
But here are my reasons : 1 . ) 	0
As a parent , I support that concept as long as the inclusion doesn ' t come at the expense of the other students in class . 	0
Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools . 	0
I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray . 	0
But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they ’ re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else . 	0
Lastly , every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too . 	0
But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don ’ t forget , don ’ t do this … this and this … or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die . 	0
You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they ’ re religion or topics . 	0
Ignorance is truly bliss . 	0
Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form . 	0
People are always afraid . 	0
Always thinking of death and what could or won ’ t happen next . 	0
Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence , someone comes up to you and says hey you know what . 	0
I can save you I can save you from what ’ s to come . 	0
If a student wishes to silently pray during my class , I do not have a problem with it . 	1
I ' m a teacher . 	0
I also don ' t think teachers / administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable . 	1
Sandy 	0
He admonished his followers : “ Always beware of vowing , it is a risky thing . 	0
So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector ? 	0
It ' s individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it ' s just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement . 	0
So , I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost . 	0
The “ evangelical prophet , ” Oswald Chambers ( 1874 – 1917 ) , saw that the empty promises made by so many Christians actually result in great “ spiritual leakage . ” 	0
I agree that this article is a crock ! 	0
My wife and I are both school teachers . 	0
I worked in the public system , and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area . 	0
In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children . 	0
If you can ' t manage that then enroll your children in an alternative school . . . it really is that simple . 	0
It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it ' s an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way . 	0
The public school system is secular , keep your religious beliefs at home . 	1
Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education , they teach evolution , they teach homosexuality generally at an early age , and some even hold classes about certain religions . 	0
How long until Muslim schools girls are told to stop exposing their face in school ? 	0
Do you have a better idea ? 	0
Use the comment field below to voice your opinion . 	0
I see benefit to both sides of the argument . 	0
I just don ' t know what the best option is . 	0
SO while the lower performing student has an aid , that high performing student is bored to tears and on a behavioral rampage . 	0
My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten , turned 5 in late Sept . She thrived socially , but was definitely " middle of the pack " academically till the end of 2nd grade , when something kicked in , and she started caring more about doing well in school . 	0
Yes everyone can stand review but at a point you lose students . 	0
The students can opt out of their accomodations , and they do to save face , further , they are not only hurting themselves , but others in the calss . 	0
The resources teacher ( their aid ) can ' t sit by there side and give them the help and attention they need due to confidentiality . 	0
We have gotten away from this " tracking " mentality , but really , the majority or resource kids I see are no better off . 	0
I have 32 kids in one class and an on level class is mixed beyond belief . 	0
I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade . 	0
Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also . 	0
My kids both have nice professional jobs . 	0
I pay my school taxes but public schools don ' t want my input , just my money . 	0
I just disagree that if public schools went away , all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be . 	0
You will never , ever regret it . 	0
Nor will your child . 	0
If you can ’ t do that , explore the many good private Christian schools that are available . 	0
But please , consider doing something . 	0
Pressure to prepare kids for these tests starts as early as kindergarten . 	0
Later , as a parent , I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand . 	0
Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private . 	0
I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system . 	0
I couldn ' t abide that my own values of respect , cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system . 	0
The teachers in both systems are the same , but the expectations of the parents are simply different . 	0
I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for ! 	0
If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to , then it is clear that you love money more than your children . 	0
I helped paint classrooms and wash windows . 	0
Would a moment of silence be out of order ? 	0
This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read ! 	0
We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school . 	0
Why can ' t we have a moment of silence ? 	0
If public school parents don ' t like their ' crappy ' school then let THEM make changes . 	0
Other parents did landscaping , waxed floors , supervised recess , helped in the kitchen , repaired the furnace and water heater , maintained the school bus , and re-sealed the driveway . 	0
This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system . 	0
We have done our share . 	0
Where will that child be best prepared to succeed in college and beyond ? 	0
Like most certified teachers I did not hold this method of education in very high regard . 	0
If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control . 	0
, specifically my bias against homeschooling before doing the research . 	0
What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something . 	1
This is not about real " choice " . 	0
When middle-class parents go private , they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor . 	0
I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more . 	0
There ' s plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them ( ie . more time at home , less time at work ) and make their home life an enriching one . 	0
How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to . 	0
Attitude to studies is all important . 	0
I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in . 	0
To me , learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit . 	0
All of our kids deserve to reach their full potential , regardless of their sex . 	0
I have written more than a hundred articles for this column and this has never happened before . 	0
If a student ' s mind is occupied with sex , drugs and alcohol you can ' t expect good results . 	0
Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won ' t matter which school he / she attends . 	0
The next thing I know there are thousands of readers “ recommending ” my article on their Facebook pages . 	0
Then I did the research and found , for the most part , that they are doing a fine job and I said so . 	1
All of us , no matter our religious beliefs , need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind . 	0
That has changed because of immigrants , the world just in general becoming smaller through computers , TV . , and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading . 	0
When I was a kid we learned religion in church , math , reading , history , etc . , in school and at home . 	0
What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves , burkas to public school as is happening in Europe ? 	0
Why are some people making it so difficult , demanding that religion be taught also in schools , alongside science ? 	0
We have some problems to face , don ' t we ? 	0
Notice these are only women ' s wear , which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female ( Americans think ) . 	0
The entire world has these problems , not just here in America , and we are the guineau pigs . 	0
Now just 38 per cent of Britons , according to a 2005 poll , believe in " a God " of any kind ( a further 40 per cent of people believe in " some sort of spirit or life force " , apparently , showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong ) . 	0
I can ' t remember the exact timeline ) homeschoolers to simply graduate . 	0
Why , because their parents pay for them to be there . 	0
After reading all the comments attached to this article I would like to address some of them : Thank you for your encouragement to homeschool my boys . 	0
In the end I would like to emphasise two things : 1 ) People have suggested that there are pros and cons , and yes , this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this ' washes out ' in the end . 	0
This is NOT true . 	0
Any decent school will have various other contacts . 	0
However , more importantly , a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people . 	0
Science can be wrong , but by far I ' ll take science over anecdotal evidence . 	0
: ) Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry . 	0
Depending on who you speak to , there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies . 	0
But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible . 	0
Again , do the research . 	0
Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are , IN GENERAL , better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools . 	0
But … 	0
And I thought , sure , because she ' s a bright kid who ' s supposed to be in 2nd grade . 	0
But I didn ' t say it . 	0
Many who say money is a factor are simply choosing to spend their resources on other things when they could spend it on freeing up the possibility of homeschooling . 	0
Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing , in a similar situation recentl ! . 	0
I have a July ' 07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall . 	0
I swear if I hear one more time ( and I know I will ) about how advanced her kid is . . . 	0
I ' m just going to say " so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs ? " 	0
It went unsaid , but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing , by sending mine . 	0
Many who say they are not temperamentally suited to homeschooling are using that as a smokescreen when the truth is they are not willing to exercise the patience and submit to the sacrifice needed to homeschool . 	0
I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age , who was holding her daughter back . 	0
She was actually totally cool , said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision , respected others choices , etc . It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing , who annoyed me . 	0
My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her . 	0
To this day , I believe it may be the most prophetic series I ’ ve ever delivered at Meck . 	0
I do not believe homeschooling is for everyone , nor the mark of whether you are a good parent . 	0
The children in the public system , some , not all , are just waiting to get out at the end of the day . 	0
I know there can be economic barriers to homeschooling . 	0
Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions . 	0
. 	0
At least one child died . 	0
Terrified students huddled in classrooms . 	0
They called 911 . 	0
They texted and tweeted . 	0
Teachers locked doors and implemented emergency procedures . 	0
And at least one teacher chased the gunman out of the school – an act of bravery that possibly saved lives . 	0
As police try to make sense of the senseless , the school superintendent called on people to pray . 	0
It was a wise decision . 	0
But perhaps lost in the chaos is the irony that in American public schools – people are not allowed to pray . 	0
Liberals have successfully banished God from the classroom , replacing Him with the manmade god of secularism . 	0
The kids are coddled , have no responsibility with the school system in this area . 	0
I think it sends the wrong message . 	0
It drives me nuts . 	0
I am in no way " Wealthy " however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background . 	0
After all , there are very few things one can do as a grown-up , short of joining a cloistered religious order , to be exclusively in a single-sex environment . 	0
I can learn and do schoolwork and still have time for loads of other experiences . 	0
They could do this at public schools but do not . 	0
The public school was a joke . 	1
So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts . 	0
It ' s a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country . 	0
Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means . 	0
Children in the public school systems ARE left behind , bullied , and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities . 	0
Private teachers have more passion about teaching because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole . 	0
The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way . 	0
Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them . 	1
Oh , but she ’ s gifted ? 	0
This isn ' t the place to argue about Planned Parenthood , but the things they say to children as young as ten are things that shouldn ' t be said without a parent ' s permission . 	0
I went K–12 to a terrible public school . 	0
Well , then , she ’ ll really be fine . 	0
You want the best for your child , but your child doesn ’ t need it . 	0
I understand . 	0
She will have support at home ( that ’ s you ! ) and all the advantages that go along with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education—the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy . 	0
Schools everywhere are failing to crack down on issues like bullying , and failing a lot of other things too . 	0
I ' m on the homeschool side of the debate . 	1
Woahhh , guys , some of this is starting to get a little attack-y . 	0
For the purpose of this argument , I ' m referring to homeschooling as any kind of flexible education : online schools , unschooling , a hodge-podge of curricula from different places , anything . 	0
That said , I don ' t believe it ' s the best in every single case . 	0
There wasn ’ t even soccer . 	0
When I asked her about it , she said , “ I think the absence of boys helped me personally because I was a shy kid , so being with all girls helped me discover myself more easily and become more outgoing without the pressure of trying to impress boys . ” 	0
Some of you with different political backgrounds may disagree , but this is what I believe . 	0
But even beyond that , I see him being very enthusiastic about learning and I want to give him as many opportunities as I can to foster that curiosity . 	0
This involves more than just the memorization of facts . 	0
Even in the story in the original post , I think mainstreaming was a good thing . 	1
Now that this person has graduated from high school , he might not be able to go on and get the types of college degrees that his peers are pursuing but maybe he could be placed in some sort of work program or job training program to help him be as independent as possible . 	0
I agree with what other posters have said . . . it depends on the individual child and how high functioning they are . 	0
If the being in a mainstream classroom is good for them and doesn ' t interfere with other students ability to learn then it is a good thing . 	0
I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private . 	1
As far as public schools go , WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight ? ? ? ? ? ? 	0
My husband and I ( my parents too ! ) sacrificed a lot to give him this education . 	0
As a parent that sent her son to private schools , I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment . 	0
His case was brought before the U . S . Supreme Court . 	0
So in some cases there ' s a safety issue . 	0

So , come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape ! 	0
The effect of this ruling is not just to eat away at the sacredness of the name of God , but to eliminate the sacredness and thereby the substance of the oath itself . 	0
Mr . Morley , writing in the Nation ’ s Business September 1961 , pointed out “ the absurdity of having an official administer to others oaths in the sanctity of which he does not himself believe . ” 	0
In other places , it ' s what kids will hear , and I ' m not talking about peers . 	0
While one child may choose an excellent set of friends and role models , another child might migrate toward the trouble makers . 	0
If he ' d stayed in preschool , it would have been another year of being the bad kid who couldn ' t play or socialize properly . 	0
His confidence has improved so much being in a big kid school and being able to easily do all the work . 	0
He met the cutoff to start at 4yo and we sent him . 	0
HIPPO ODS will never be socially en par with his peers , but was reading and writing and adding by 4yo . 	0

They do not impose significantly on the other traditions . 	0
Both are reasonable accommodations . 	0
Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray . 	1
I see no issue here . 	0
Fact : Muslims pray five times daily , in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting . 	0
This is just silliness . 	0
For example , Jehovah ' s Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem , because they only recognize the Kingdom of God . 	0
Fact : we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups . 	0
You will soon understand the failings of the public school system . 	0
The idea that I should consider a lower level of achievement for my children so that the public schools MIGHT improve is ridiculous . 	0
When you remove God you invite everything that is wicked to come in and destroy . 	0
I believe the demise of our schools are solely due in part to the removal of prayer in schools . 	1
Removal of prayer in schools is not a violation of the third amendmant . 	0
In a blog for Yahoo ! , Clayton writes that the real motivator behind downsizing special education classrooms by mainstreaming students with disabilities into general education classes is a desire to save money , not an effort to do what ’ s best for students with disabilities . 	0
The removal of prayer may not be the only cause of social ills , but the negative trends are certainly a symptom of the spiritual decline which is at their root . 	0
She always has the best advice , no matter the topic , and was so happy that I inquired about her opinion on the subject of our education . 	0
Overall , she was happy with the all-girls experience , thinking maybe four years would have been a little better than six , but self-discovery was her biggest gain out of the school . 	0
Of course , it all really depends on the person . 	0
I reached out to some of the girls that I have remained very close with , and their opinions differ from mine quite a bit . 	0

My friend Olivia is as sweet as can be . 	0
Which uniform style are YOU wearing ? 	0
Anyone who was anybody carried their books in a Dylan ’ s Candy Bar tote , then of course the accusations would fly about who really started the trend and who was copying whom . 	0
EVERYONE had the same one ! 	0
All-estrogen environments at that age thrive on gossip and making oneself seem holier-than-thou to at least a few girls . 	0
The cost for specialized services to children with disabilities far outweighs the cost of mainstreaming them into regular classrooms where they are unlikely to receive the specialized services they need , Clayton wrote . 	0
It ' s just embarrassing to see what the United States is becoming . 	0
Slate . com decided to take the helm with a piece by Allison Benedikt called “ If You Send Your Kid to Private School , You Are a Bad Person . ” 	0
We ’ re not even into the article and the judgements are flying . 	0
Or do you homeschool or unschool ? 	0
Regardless of what might work best for your own child and family , there is plenty of public opinion that will tell you that whatever you ’ ve decided is inherently wrong . 	0
Private ? 	0
Charter ? 	0
What school do you send your child to ? 	0
Public ? 	0
This week , many kids , including my own , are headed back to school . 	0
And , like anything parenting-related , school brings along with it its own heaping pile of judgement . 	0
I didn ' t know one person who did drugs at my co-ed high school , or know anyone who had access to drugs . 	0
The girls at my all-girls school got drugs from the boys they knew ( all outside of school , of course , as it was an all-girls school ) . 	0
Whereas girls who go to all-girls schools will hang out with guys from another school ( maybe their " brother " school ) , guys from the train station , the arcade . 	0
Surely as a parent you ' d feel more OK knowing that your daughter was with someone she knew ? 	0
. 	0
. 	0
They tend to be more open to hanging out with guys they ' ve just met – and not really knowing anything about them . 	0
you get my drift . 	0
And if they ' re not getting it at school , they ' ll get it elsewhere . 	0
Girls LIKE male attention . 	0
A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2011 said that starting kindergarten one year late " substantially reduces the probability of repeating the third grade , and meaningfully increases in tenth grade math and reading scores . 	0
He instills fear into people . 	0
All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that . 	0
You cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers , Jewish prayers , Hindu , Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others . 	0
Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff . 	0
If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it , don ’ t you think . 	0
You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is , is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one . 	0
Because no one knows what the right one is . 	0
Why are there so many religions in the world . 	0
How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man . 	0
Look at it this way . 	0
How many home educated children do you hear of that have ASBO ’ s ? 	0
How many home educated children to you hear of committing suicide ? 	0
@ calminthestorm . 	0
I certainly know more than 3 home educated people , non of which went off the rails , yet I could compile a huge list of children that attended school who did . 	0
As for social interacting , I used to go on camping trips , day trips , I would study with friends by rivers , in the woods , on the beach or just pop round to each others houses . 	0
It was such a positive and wonderful experience , my parents travelled far and wide to give me these experiences , for that I will always admire them ! 	0
For the record , my parents aren ’ t hippies , or God fearing Christians . 	0
Also to sate that home educating families are middle class could not be further from the truth , with four children and my father receiving a pitiful wage as a hill farmer and my mum being an unpaied housewife , they , nor I fall into the bizarre and inaccurate stereo type of a home educated family . 	0
To assume parents who home school are ‘ cruel ’ could not be more wrong . 	0
To send a distressed and terrified child to school everyday is sick ! 	0
As supporters of this campaign against public teachers unions , it only makes sense that the news media ignores important books such as The Public School Advantage : Why Public Schools Outperform Private Schools . 	0
Charter schools , vouchers for private schools , school and school district takeovers — virtually all right-wing school reform efforts attack public school teachers because they are unionized and therefore make a decent wage . 	0
Weakening unions is one key strategy in the thirty-year class war in which wealth has been transferred from the middle class and poor up the economic ladder to the wealthy . 	0
The news media will certainly give fair coverage to both sides of most labor disputes , but in feature coverage they give far greater voice to anti-union pundits , writers , politicians , theories and events than to those in support of unions . 	0
The news media , owned as they are by large companies , have come to share big business ’ disdain for unions , especially over the past thirty years . 	0
In the case of education , it ’ s just not so , but the news media filters out this important news for ideological reasons . 	0
One of the ideological tenets of the mass media is that the private sector always outperforms the public sector . 	0
Nor was I surprised that the news media has ignored the Lubienski book . 	0
Are private schools better or worse ? 	0
Should private schools be allowed to compete with public schools ? 	0
However , school vouchers are illegal in most states , so this solution is not available to most parents . 	0
The most common solution to this problem is called a school voucher , which is essentially a tax rebate for parents that they can use to pay private tuition . 	0
What do you think ? 	0
Many polls have indicated that the American public is supportive to the idea of school vouchers , but national teacher ’ s unions oppose them , and so far they have not become a mainstream alternative to public school . 	0
The primary obstacle to creating more private schools is cost . 	0
A private school can choose to create a new curriculum for auto mechanics if it wants to , and doesn ’ t need to ask the government for permission or funding . 	0
Many parents do not have enough money to both pay school taxes and pay for tuition at a private school . 	0
Right now , all citizens of the U . S . pay taxes to maintain their local schools . 	0
We are not number one in any single category . 	0
We are a second rate nation when it comes to education and while were ' at it we aren ' t exactly a shinning example of exemplary medicine either . 	0
All that would accomplish is further reducing the number of properly educated young people . 	0
Look at the world achievement rankings of our young people . 	0
According to a report issued by the National Center for Education Statistics in spring 2011 , the scores for kindergarten entry were higher for delayed-entry kindergartners and on-time kindergartners than for repeating kindergartners . 	0
We find substantial variation in practices across schools , with schools serving larger proportions of white and high-income children having far higher rates of delayed entry , " noted the report , " The Extent , Patterns , and Implications of Kindergarten ' Redshirting , ' " issued in April 2013 . 	0
No thanks . 	0
If you don ' t believe that they are as bad as I think they are , then you need only pay close attention when you ' re in a situation where young people might be talking or better yet when they are at a check out register . 	0
Some parents are even delaying schooling to give their children a competitive advantage in sports , or to delay admission age to college . 	0
Parents might think their child is not emotionally ready to leave home , or not socially or academically adept . 	0
" We find that between 4 and 5 . 5 percent of children delay kindergarten , a lower number than typically reported … 	0
A joint study by the University of Virginia and Stanford University released in 2013 established a relationship between red shirting and socio-economic status and ethnicity . 	0
It ' s a phenomenon known as redshirting . 	0
More parents are putting off a child ' s kindergarten entry so he or she will be a little older than the classmates . 	0
" It has always been in practice , but it has gotten more attention recently and people are talking more about it , " said Vela , a mother of three and a preschool teacher for 25 years . 	0
" The reasons parents choose to redshirt their child vary , depending on the child ' s emotional , social and academic readiness to join school , " Dana Vela , president of Sunrise Preschools , in Arizona , said in an interview with ABCNews . com . 	0
Social education is important , alongside academics . 	0
Truth be told College may not be in his future , but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there . 	0
It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom . 	0
From the home educators ' point of view , however , the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step . 	0
The real world is not segregated , nor are universities . 	0
We tried to mainstream him in kindergarten , but he had a hard time adjusting . 	0
My child was in " preschool handicapped " from age 2-5 . 	0
lf not , it can backfire on the child . 	0
l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream . 	0
We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan , he sees therapists , and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him . 	0
Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school . 	0
2 grades later , he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT . 	0
So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit . 	0
I ' ll be putting this view into practise when my daughter is old enough . 	0
Why can ' t we find a situation where he is happy AND can receive an appropriate education and related services ? 	0
The tragic case of Khyra Ishaq prompted Ed Balls to commission a review of home education in 2009 that was undertaken by Graham Badman . 	0
Thankfully , the teacher situation seems to have stabilized . 	0
Yet , they still seem ill-equipped to deal with behavior problems . 	0
The non-public school director has said repeatedly that we are welcome to take our child out of her school since she has a waiting list , whenever we have brought up concerns . 	0
( Our biggest concern was the revolving door that teachers were on in 2006 / 07 : 3 teachers quit in 1 year . ) 	0
The non-public school has a very unwelcome attitude towards parent involvement , and even to questions and concerns that parents may raise . 	0
The idea that child abuse can be thwarted by tightening laws about home education has been around for some time . 	0
It seems that Khyra ' s last hope was that the local authority ' s home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school . 	0
What does that tell ya about are public school system ? 	0
He reached the same conclusions as this week ' s serious case review – that the law be changed to ensure that social services speak to children to assess if home education is in their interests . 	0
My problem is when a parent doesn ' t put the effort in to socialize the kids , they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group . 	0
They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing , I think that ' s a good thing . 	0
I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test . 	0
Writers have a responsibility to be unbiased . 	0
Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA . 	0
I send my son to a Catholic School and last year I saw what they were doing . 	0
Far better than when I was at that grade and far better than the local public school . 	0
This writer is not thinking . 	0
We all want our children to get a good education . 	0
A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD . 	0
A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD . 	0
In this age group ( senior high school ) , the benefits were larger and more consistent across the board for girls than for boys . 	0
The National Foundation for Educational Research conducted a study in which they observed and calculated of 2 , 954 high schools ( both co-ed and single-sex ) throughout England and found , " Even after controlling for students ' academic ability and other background factors , both girls and boys did significantly better in single-sex schools than in coed schools . 	0
It is very clear by the above chart that both sexes academically benefit from a single-sex education . 	0
But then we have studies that show the numbers . 	0
Advantages have not been demonstrated . " 	0
That ' s not to say that academic outcomes are definitively worse , but neither are they definitively better . 	0
Penn State ' s very own , psychology professor Lynn S . Liben claims there is no academic benefit to a single-sex education , " Our examination of the existing studies leads us to conclude that there is not scientific evidence for positive effects of single-sex schooling . 	0
So , while the single-sex atmosphere allowed young women at my school to branch out and express themselves without the restriction of the opposite sex , some may argue that it could have instilled an anxiety associated with the opposite sex . 	0
It ' s been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools . 	0
For higher-achieving boys , there was no statistically significant effect of school type on performance , positive or negative . " 	0
Specifically , girls at all levels of academic ability did better in single-sex schools than in coed schools ; whereas for boys , the beneficial effect of single-sex schools was significant only for boys at the lower end of the ability scale . 	0
Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class . 	0
Yes , out public school system is broken , but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools ' job , nothing is going to change . 	0
I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government . 	0
However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding . 	0
I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips , work experience , careers etc . I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright . 	0
Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made , e . g IT provision in every lesson , access to a scribe , extended time to sit exams and submit homework , leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors . 	0
They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times . 	0
The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit . 	0
One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA ' s to children . 	0
I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both . 	0
I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children . 	0
I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children . 	0
More over , they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended . 	0
This is what ALL schools should aspire to be . 	0
There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school . 	0
The single-sex education question is , at least in part , a legal one , but it is also a scientific one . 	0
The ACLU ’ s findings have led them to challenge the sex-segregated programs in several states and even file a lawsuit against a West Virginia program . 	0
As a result they were , in fact , decidedly unequal . 	0
Many of them relied on outdated and scientifically unfounded stereotypes of boys and girls to drive their curriculum . 	0
But , in the absence of high-quality research , why err on the side of segregation ? 	0
Perhaps if we do a better job of having the scientific conversation about whether or not single-sex education actually works we wouldn ’ t have to have the conversation about the legality . 	0
At the moment we simply don ’ t have sufficient evidence to say that single-sex education in the US actually works . 	0
I am the only quiet person in this loud family . 	0
I have little reason to think that one day , Ryan will wake up with a hushed demeanor . 	0
Hard though it may be to believe , the public school was better on these issues . 	0
Additionally , Ryan can have short attention span , especially if he ’ s bored . 	0
( Please , pass me another glass of wine ) . 	0
I worry some about her going off to college at age 17 , but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been . 	0
( His hearing has been tested and , yes , he ’ s fine ) . 	0
I ’ ve often wondered – if God is good enough for the bad times , shouldn ’ t He be good enough for the good times ? 	0
Yet in times of great tragedy , school leaders inevitably seek guidance and solace from the same God they ’ ve expelled . 	0
Another issue is Ryan ’ s loudness . 	0
But his father is loud and so is his older sister . 	0
It ’ s as if he ’ s a broken volume button on an old radio , stuck on high no matter what . 	0
Now she ' s in 7th grade , and still at the top of her class . 	0
Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL . 	0
That if someone is FEELING bad and they don ’ t FEEL like going to work today then they don ’ t . 	0
Here are the facts . 	0
So it ' s really up to the parent to decide for their child , " said Vela . 	0
You also find children who are ready to leave home at an even younger age . 	0
A few weeks ago I posted some thoughts on the impact of Title IX beyond collegiate athletics and last week my colleague , Markus Gerke , wrote brilliantly about the myth of the boy crisis in education . 	0
In this post I will illustrate how Title IX proponents and believers in the boy crisis myth have come to clash over the topic of single-sex education . 	0
We need a moral adjustment , not a legislative one . ) 	0
There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school . 	0
Everyone , all in . 	0
( By the way : Banning private schools isn ’ t the answer . 	0
None of these are compelling reasons . 	0
Or , rather , the compelling ones ( behavioral or learning issues , wanting a not-subpar school for your child ) are exactly why we should all opt in , not out . 	0
Yes , some do it for prestige or out of loyalty to a long-standing family tradition or because they want their children to eventually work at Slate . 	0
But many others go private for religious reasons , or because their kids have behavioral or learning issues , or simply because the public school in their district is not so hot . 	0
I believe in public education , but my district school really isn ’ t good ! 	0
you might say . 	0
We are also far from rich . 	0
Last week I learned the definition of “ going viral . ” 	0
I didn ' t feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons , and when he was " blowing " neither did anyone else . 	0
There , I said it . 	0
Every single solitary teacher I ' ve spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade . 	0
I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated . 	0
FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first . 	0
But being at the tail end of this , you can ' t tell after that . 	0
So the question is : Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go ? 	0
If you really can ' t tell - why don ' t you just follow the rules ? 	0
You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids . 	0
Every once in a while a child might stand out but it ' s not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem " older " or " younger " I don ' t necessarily disagree with you . 	0
The teacher says she can ' t tell any difference at all . 	0
As the temporary alliance between Liz Sayce and Maria Miller proves , this can make for some very unlikely bedfellows . 	0
BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly . 	0
Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem , a joy , really , and my job ! 	0
No wonder students who have been divided by sex for years need help learning how to work and learn together . 	0
Here ’ s the bottom line : many of our schools are in trouble and coming out of the largest recession since the 1930s , with mounting national debt , we have limited resources . 	0
Perhaps this outcome isn ’ t surprising . 	0
Social scientists have found that labeling and separating students based on almost any characteristic ( e . g . , sex , eye color , randomly assigned t-shirts ) makes those differences even more salient to the students and produces intergroup bias . 	0
Got that ? 	0
Instead of focusing on techniques that have been proven to improve academic outcomes , the school has to spend its limited resources teaching boys and girls to play well with each other . 	0
So , the right of kids to pray in school is not only not banned , but even constitutionally protected . 	0
In fact , the Bill of Rights ’ First Amendment protects both the right to freedom of speech ( prayer can obviously be a form of speech ) as well as the right to free exercise of religion ( praying also obviously qualifies as exercising one ’ s religion ) . 	0
Kids pray all the time in school ( often right before a quiz or exam ) . 	0
This is nonsense . 	0
The dearest private schools with long heritage of generations of pupils from the one family don ' t show it theses days . . . 	0
Sports on Saturdays music classes drama classes etc the catholic school that ' s says 95% is reflecting their area . . 	0
Having previously discussed why teaching creationism in public school science classes , or posting the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms , are both inappropriate and unconstitutional , I suppose it ’ s perhaps time now to take a look at the whole heated issue of the place of prayer in U . S . public schools . 	0
Article failed to justify the heading lost the plot along the way . . 	0
However , please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people , and not to the government . 	0
And , in actual fact , no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want ( so long as it isn ’ t disruptive , of course — a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression ) . 	0
Today , parents who homeschool don ' t even worry about high school or diplomas . 	0
Still , it seems that should be some oversight to prevent children from falling through the cracks . 	0
Both sides of this debate have a compelling case . 	0
And it is entirely possible that some children might receive a better education at home than they would in any of the available schools they could attend . 	0
Unfortunately , for parents who cannot afford private education , live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school , the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn . 	0
Parents should not be judged for trying to do what ' s best for their children . 	0
I also recognize that there are deep roots to explore when we look at who is attending private versus public schools , and it certainly bears looking at why people make those choices , rather than dismissing them as not compelling enough like Benedikt does . 	0
Using Benedikt ’ s rational , if everyone sent their kids to public schools they would somehow magically improve . 	0
And due to cost , location , waiting lists , and other issues , sometimes Catholic school or another private school is not an option ( though home schooling versus Catholic schools has been a whole other debate ) . 	0
Out in the Western suburbs , where we can afford to live , public high schools just won ' t do unless you ' re happy for your kids to be beaten up , spat on , thrown rocks at , and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day . 	0
How can they learn and grow in such a place , even with high involvement and support from home ? 	0
Don ' t need statistics , just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they ' re being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing , i . e . bullying , attire , social attitude , etc . The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating . 	0
Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them ! 	1
An outgoing & popular bright teenager transformed into one hiding in closets to avoid school . 	0
Some parents feel that public schools will contradict the religious values they are attempting to teach their kids . 	0
We tried it . 	0
Pulled one of our kids out of a private school into the local public school . 	0
Sometimes local public schools are themselves doing a poor job of educating students . 	0
I don ’ t think my family is the worst-case scenario , ” he told the Post . 	0
“ Who knows how many of these families are out there ? 	0
However , it should be made clear that coeducation can also foster good mental and emotional situations . 	0
Since private schools compete with each other to gain students , they have a strong incentive to hire good teachers and offer good courses . 	0
For a variety of reasons , boys in a classroom has an overall negative impact on girls ' learning . 	0
. 	0
My two cents . 	0
But a friend in my all-girls school showed me some drugs IN school . 	0
. 	0
As always there were honourable exceptions . 	0
About 80% of the time you could pick the private school repeats , who immediately asked ' what ' s the answer ? ' rather than ' how can we work it out ? ' 	0
Our kids attended state schools and excelled , one to doctoral level . 	0
Thanks for an entertaining , very timely infomercial for conservative state governments . 	0
SV , that reflects my personal experience of teaching matriculation courses in TAFE . 	0
They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids . . . and research indicates that coddled , spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears . . . . 	0
Sometimes some of us are trying to make the world a better place starting with our children . 	0
I credit my earlier classroom experiences for my chutzpah . 	0
But being a social scientist I can ' t help but look to the literature ( incidentally , the well-researched footnotes are one of Lean In ' s strongest features , and worth a read ) , and that ' s when the picture becomes more complicated . 	0
At 13 I would have said that of course girls need to be bossy -- who else would lead ? 	0
As far as prayer in school , I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate . 	1
I took this attitude with me into high school , a building that sat next to an all-boys ' school . 	0
Some of my classes were coed . 	0
The boys came over for European history and drama , classes where I always positioned myself in the front row , preferring the " visiting " boys sit behind me . 	0
To my teenage self they were clearly infringing on my territory and I made sure I outperformed them . 	0
That confidence translated when I went next door for Latin , where I righteously covered my tests with my arm to make sure the boy sitting behind me couldn ' t cheat off of me ( a trick he only got away with once ) . 	0
When I arrived at Harvard ( also Sandberg ' s alma mater ) I was never afraid to raise my hand in a seminar , and I quickly learned that the best way to be heard meant jumping into the discussion and not waiting to be recognized . 	0
Most institutions now accept parents ' transcripts , letters from community members , SAT scores and entrance exam scores as proof of achievement . 	0
Colleges and universities are now recognizing that homeschooled children ' s education is as well-rounded as that of their peers . 	0
In the private school system , the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student , even if that mean expelling them from the school . 	0
All of these situations encourage development of social and conflict-resolution skills , expect courteous and respectful behavior and expose children to diversity . 	0
While it is true that they may not spend six hours of every day with same-age peers , many homeschooled children are from large families , are involved in extracurricular activities and lessons , and volunteer in the community . 	0
Socialization One of the most common arguments against homeschooling is that children who learn at home will not have opportunities to socialize with their peers . 	0
Others might purchase commercial online or DVD-based curricula . 	0
Some may hire a tutor or belong to a cooperative where parents take turns teaching in their area of expertise . 	0
This may have been accurate in the past but today , even if parents do not have the required skill set , they have many options . 	0
Meeting Academic Standards Another argument against homeschooling is that students may not be exposed to the same rigorous curriculum standards at home as they would be at school , which would make it difficult to be accepted at postsecondary institutions . 	0
Sadly , my college chose to go co-ed years ago . 	0
It left a hole in my heart . 	0
1 ) There ' s no reason to suspect it matters . 	0
Most people who send their children to private schools would prefer to save the money and go public . . . if only that system could provide a first class education . 	0
Women spoke . 	0
Assertively . 	0
I am a scientist and I believe in data over anecdote , yet I experienced the beneficial effects of single-sex education myself . 	0
After co-ed public high school and a freshman year at a co-ed university , I transferred to a women ' s college and the difference was astonishing . 	0
When I went to law school , and later to grad school , I could always pick out the women who attended women ' s colleges . 	0
We all could . 	0
Being intellectual and smart was cool . 	0
Speaking up was cool . 	0
My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator . 	0
Prayer , or more specifically , the annual See You at the Pole . 	0
And I do mean facts : Homeschooled children significantly outperform children educated in public school systems in reading , language , math , science and social studies . 	0
And I totally understand Benedikt ’ s line of thinking . 	0
Ultimately , we as a society lose . 	0
Our society just isn ' t gear for that . 	0
" I have studied how children learn and develop and have been in the field of early care and education for more than 30 years . 	0
CNN should not publish such nonsense . 	0
" This is just plain wrong . 	0
" Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade . 	0
As private individuals , kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been ; in fact , their right to do so is constitutionally protected . 	0
So , if you studied this ( evidently , without much success ) , why so you resort to anecdotal information ? 	0
The greatest part of my knowledge comes from my own children . . " 	0
Those who can afford to bail on trying to improve the system and end up sending their children to private school rather than work on improving public ones . 	0
It ’ s just that it has been widely recognized that it is clearly unconstitutional for the state ( and , by extension , state schools ) to officially sanction , sponsor , offer , or conduct prayers . 	0
I give up other things to do that . 	0
I work hard and the American way allows me to make those choices . 	0
I just pulled my child out of public school because of the incompetent teachers there . 	0
I have always been involved in my children ' s education in the public school . 	0
I am a teacher myself and I give 100% of me everyday to my students but unfortunately where my kids go to school they don ' t . 	0
I am thank-ful I could afford to send them to a private school . 	0
And that ' s what scares these selfish people that want to take away people ' s freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do ! 	0
After all , the public school systems get tax money from everyone , even from the one ' s who send their kids to private schools . 	0
And the public school doesn ' t provide anything for those kids , but the system still takes their money . 	0
I have three children with kid ' s of the their own , one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school , the other home school ' s her children , while my other children still go to a public school . . . . but they ' re father is a teacher . . . . thank God ! ! 	0
public education is for the most part terrible , and it ' s too bad that our government had to step in and ruin what was working ! ! 	1
maybe someday we ' ll elect official ' s that give the people what they really want , instead of slamming they ' re own agenda ' s down our throat ! ! ! 	0
In some schools , mainstreaming of students with disabilities is used only for those classes in which the child has ability to keep up with peers , according to SEA . 	0
Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won ' t be a bad person . 	0
The self consciousness hinders students from asking questions in class , and therefore students get more frustrated by not understanding the material . 	0
There is an event happening at schools all across the country later this month that , according to Freedom From Religion Foundation ( “ FFRF ” ) , people need to be warned about . 	0
Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies . 	0
Our government is based upon hate . 	0
Our entire society is based upon hate . 	0
When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families , their neighbors and each other , then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed " different " -- and not in the good way . 	0
But at least Benedikt acknowledges it : “ I ’ m just judgmental . 	0

I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters . 	1
Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting / stabbing . 	0
I once read , admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication , that a child , if properly taught , can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school . 	0
Back in the mid-nineties , when I was reporting on single-sex classrooms , evolutionary psychology was hot , and “ hardwired ” was the new buzz word , injected like a vitamin shot into weak arguments . 	0
I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums . 	0
Additionally , private schools are not encumbered by national teacher ’ s unions or political correctness . 	0
Private schools that compete with each other for students will be forced to find the best teachers available , and will be able to offer flexibility that meets each individual ’ s educational needs . 	0
OTOH , one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline ( school tries to , parents object ) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns . 	0
We can test a child academically but we can never test their emotional readiness . 	0

But it seems to me that if every single parent sent every single child to public school , public schools would improve . 	0
The report that an increasing number of parents in this country are seeking to homeschool their children is not at all surprising . 	0
However , some persons expressed confusion about this admission from an official of the Ministry of Education recently , because of the high standard of education we afford our children at the nursery , primary and secondary levels . 	0
But rich people will always find a way to game the system : That shouldn ’ t be an argument against an all-in approach to public education any more than it is a case against single-payer health care . ) 	0
( Yes , rich people might cluster . 	0
The media coverage here and abroad about bullying , teasing as well as physical and emotional abuse in public schools is abundant , and it could make a parent want to protect their children from that bad environment . 	0
Certainly there are advantages and disadvantages to homeschooling and if it is an area that is gaining currency in this country , the relevant authorities will need to do some probing to ensure that parents are giving their children instruction in the right manner , and are not in fact putting their children at a disadvantage . 	0
Unless there are individual circumstances I wouldn ' t be sending my children to a single sex school . 	1
Indeed , if homeschooling is really on the rise , Government may have to seek parliamentary approval to institute laws and regulations to govern this method of teaching . 	0
Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools . 	0
Low-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts ; for example , they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas , where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements . 	0
Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education . 	0
Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts : for example , where government services are largely absent , such as in rural Pakistan . 	0
In doing this , the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank . 	0
Over the past three years , the Department for International Development ( DFID ) has made the controversial move to support low-cost private schools in some countries , such as Nigeria , Ghana , or Pakistan , where public education systems are in desperate need of investment . 	0
This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries ? 	0
Indeed , a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision , despite acknowledging the fact that “ there is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money ” . 	0
I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child . 	0
It certainly is not surprising , therefore , that Christian parents and those who have strong belief systems choose to homeschool their children instead of their developing questionable values in the public school system . 	0
I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home . 	0
In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment , as it is the only sustainable solution . 	0
Pakistan spends only 2 . 4% of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP . 	0
Then , in first grade , we asked he be placed in inclusive classrooms for non-academic subjects with an aide . 	0
He made academic gains and seemed very happy . 	0
The first year was great . 	0
So he ended up in a segregated , structured special ed . classroom . 	0
We didn ' t know the questions to ask , period . 	0
First of all , we didn ' t know he had a right to inclusion . 	0
In real life , it hasn ' t worked so well for my son . 	0
In theory , I absolutely support inclusion . 	0
What a hypocritical message we send to our children when we allow laws to be passed which limit the free expression of speech in public by banning public prayer in classrooms . 	0
Federal and Supreme Court judges should be impeached who undermine the freedom upon which this country was founded . 	0
He didn ' t have any friends among the peers without disabilities . 	0
By the second semester , it became apparent he was slipping behind academically in his special ed . classes . 	0
But that ' s a whole bag opened : why do some parents not care ? 	0
—but there is always going to be bullying . 	0
On the other hand , some parents were fabulous , agreeing to hand me the leads to the X-Box until I decided the work had improved , or calling on my phone in my lesson to check up . 	0
That , not race , is the difference . 	0
It ' s not something I expect to improve under this government , which has already basically written off a whole sector of society as not worth it . 	0
the fact that they feel comfortable enough telling me is testament to this fact . 	0
It ’ s a lesson I sadly suspect our nation ’ s educators will never learn . 	0
—The boys forget how to act around women and go cuckoo bananas when they go on a field trip together —many girls complain about it ; however , many others have told me that they like it because they are insecure about " being bad readers " and feel more comfortable in an all-girls environment . 	0
The fervency with which school prayer is opposed is not because the ACLU ( an anti-Christian legal group ) is trying to protect atheist from being indoctrinated by religion . 	0
I teach single sex classes to 7th and 8th grade students IN the Bronx similar to in the article and here is what I ' ve found . 	0
Humanism assumes that the supernatural does not exist and that reality must be discovered purely from man ' s reasoning . 	0
Our public school system has been operating on this foundation since prayer was removed in 1962 . 	0
Since prayer was eliminated from public schools , the quality of education has shown a steady statistical decline . 	0
Is there a link between the two ? 	0
It tells students that they are more than just a collection of chemicals and energy that happen to be occupying space and time . 	0
Returning prayer to school would be an affront to this philosophy because prayer acknowledges the existence of someone greater than man . 	0
Allowing prayer in school sets an important standard . 	0
As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education , give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky . 	0
Of course , then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too . 	0
You mean when most children weren ' t educated at all , they just worked on their parent ' s farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write ? 	0
Let ' s face facts , if we did away with public education , most private schools are religious these days , that ' s where people would have to turn . 	0
I know that there are plenty of homeschoolers who turn out just fine . . . but I ' ve never met them in reality . 	0
Again , I do apologize if anyone finds this offensive in any way . 	0
Because I was never allowed to socialize with them as a child . 	0

One was the youngest in his class . 	0
By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears . 	0
Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated . 	0

The other is the 2nd oldest in his class . 	0
After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library , books were only as good as the pictures . 	0
In fact , The National Home Education Research Institute ( NHERI ) reports that homeschoolers actually participate in approximately five different social activities outside the home on a regular basis : boy / girl scouts , dance , swimming lessons , Sunday School , 4-H , homeschool co-ops , sports , theater , music classes and field trips . 	0
Honestly ? 	0
I do however think that one of the biggest pros to homeschooling though ( for those who do it properly and not take advantage of the way the system works ) is that kids can learn at their own pace w / o having to slow down or speed up to suit another child in their class . 	0
More students attending public school doesn ’ t automatically mean more involved parents either . 	0
How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? 	0
I went to both , public and private . 	0
The essential difference were the students . 	0
And it makes all the difference . 	0
How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? 	0
I wholeheartedly support public education and in fact , our plans include sending our son to public middle and high school . 	1
Or … they ’ d be overcrowded . 	0
The way the current system works , schools in lower-class neighborhoods are overcrowded and underfunded , while schools in wealthier districts enjoy the benefits of higher taxes — and yet , even many of them are also underfunded . 	0
I wish we had a better way to fund schools then based on property lines and tax dollars . 	0
Benedikt , in her push to help promote public education , seems to think that the best way to fix the public school system is to shame parents into sending all the kids there . 	0
And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed . 	0
The current formula for funding public schools doesn ’ t automatically mean a bunch more money per school for each new student who enrolls . 	0
Overcrowding public schools isn ’ t going to solve anything . 	0
Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn ' t speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something . 	0
So , the data about the high percentage of the home-schooling students that graduate and that attended top universities such Harvard , Stanford , Yale , etc . is based on those students I saw in that award ceremony . 	0
No more will she ever go to a public school again . 	1
My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education , attend mass daily , be safe , and learn . 	0
And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her . 	0
In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade . 	0
This will be her second year . 	0
Their teaching methods , no matter how hard I tried to understand , just did not work for me . 	0
As a disabled person with an interest in politics , the conversation sometimes turns to education . 	0
I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means . 	0
The media often frame the argument as one of “ integration ” and “ segregation ” . 	0
However , I personally feel that this is a gross oversimplification which sometimes leads those who proclaim to be allies of the disabled down risky paths . 	0
This was made clear to me last year when disabled charities advocated the closure of the Remploy factories on similar grounds . 	0
I tried SO hard to understand , I didn ’ t want to be ‘ behind ’ the other kids , but it was no good . 	0
Not having it . . . . . . So you can judge and tell me I ' m wrong , but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools . 	0
This week , examiner . com is having a promo called , “ The Great Debate : to homeschool or not . ” 	0
Why are public educators and superintendents concerned about the growing number of parents who are homeschooling their kids ? 	0
No matter how hard I tried it was not good enough . 	0
Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments . 	0
I was home educated from aged 10 onwards ; my parents were the most fantastic , enthusiastic teachers . 	0
Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum , what happens in the classroom , discipline , or anything else . 	0
Public schools are not influenced by parents , that ' s hooey . 	0
My personal experience of mainstream school was damaging . 	0
My parents didn ’ t take me out of school to ‘ protect me from the world ’ , good grief what a stupid thing to do ! 	0
I wrote this paragraph on a prior commentary because it is a fallacy that a great percentage of the home-schooling students attended top universities : I disagree that all the public schools in Maryland are bad . 	1
The most obvious reason is that with fewer students enrolling in public school , there will be lesser funds going into the system . 	0
Also remember that there ’ s more to education than what ’ s taught . 	0
Being Jewish , nun wasn ’ t really an option . 	0
Thanks in part to Sandberg and her Facebook team , I know that many of the girls I attended middle and high school with have made a variety of different choices as women : some are married , many have children , and some are stay-at-home moms while others are doctors or lawyers ( one even premiered at the Metropolitan Opera this month , while still nursing her five-month-old son ) . 	0
But we can know how people assess their experiences -- like me and my former classmates . 	0
This knowledge and the confidence that comes with it can ' t be discounted . 	0
I wasn ’ t going to an all-women ’ s college , and how many jobs are there where there are strictly women in the workplace ? 	0
Other studies have acknowledged that all-girls ' education doesn ' t necessarily improve academic performance , but they haven ' t found that it hurts either . 	0
Short of being able to do twin experiments ( where one identical twin goes to a coed school and the other goes to a single-sex school ) , we may never know the precise effect of what learning in a single-sex environment does for girls . 	0
A well-publicized 2011 Science paper disagreed , proclaiming that single-sex education can have a long-term negative effect by promoting gender stereotypes . 	0
And while we ' re at it , ladies , it ' s also worth remembering that shaving your legs every day isn ' t a necessity -- and not doing so leaves more time for all kinds of leaning in . 	0
Of course not . 	0
In fact it ’ s part of the reason I feel so strongly about public schools . 	0
Give me a break ! 	0
His argument was that because girls are more structured and academically oriented than boys that more girls in the classroom would give the boys more “ positive school behavior ” to model . 	0
In study conducted by Mieke Van Houte ( 2004 ) he examined whether or not the presence of girls affected the achievement and behavior of boys . 	0
Boys take a more laid-back approach , work less hard , and are distracted more quickly . 	0
“ In general it is stated that girls spend more time doing homework , display less disturbing behaviour in the classroom and play truant less often . 	0
I believe the far more important thing to consider in the single-sex vs . coeducational debate is whether or not the attitudes and emotions of the children involved are adversely or positively affected . 	0
It has been noted in the previous sections that single-sex education can provide a more structured learning environment for both boys and girls . 	0
So maybe the debate really has no footing at all , maybe it is just inherent that boys do not like school as much as girls ? 	0
“ Recently , various studies have demonstrated that boys are less motivated than girls and hold less positive attitudes towards school than girls ( Van Houte , 2004 ) . ” 	0
In another study conducted by Salomone ( 2006 ) she states “ There is some indication that single-sex classes may develop greater self-confidence and broader interests especially among adolescents … . girls report that they feel more comfortable … interact more with teachers … and develop more favorable attitudes towards these subjects ( math and science ) . ” 	0
( Van Houte , 2004 ) ” The study found that indeed the more girls that are in the classroom , the better the boys perform ( Van Houte , 2004 ) , it also found out that it is not so much the mere presence of girls as it is the proportion of girls . 	0
Some children , depending on disposition , may enjoy a single sex school more as they may not make friends from the other sex easily , and being solely around children of their own sex could develop their self-confidence . 	0
Advantages to sending your child to a single sex school include : children will be encouraged to learn how to interact with the other sex , despite not being able to interact every day . 	1
They are also exposed to how different the opposite sex can be , and how to cope with situations that come with being in a co-ed school . 	0
Children are able to interact daily with those from the opposite sex , allowing them to develop their social skills and have a variety of friendships . 	0
Let ’ s look at the advantages to sending your child to a co-ed school . 	1
Since each child is different , there is no specific formula to decide on a school . 	0
Since , the ultimate decision lies with the parents , focus needs to be on how the child would respond to either type of school , based on their personality , interests and general likes and dislikes . 	0
Parents often debate this issue , with many having issues with both co-ed and single sex schools . 	0
The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole . 	0
Being aware of your child ’ s personality is crucial in determining which school you should choose , regardless of whether its co-ed or single sex , since a school ’ s academics , sports and cultural activities are vital issues . 	0
I couldn ' t come up with a more illogical argument . 	0
Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school , even if they voiced their concerns . 	0
So , why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately ? 	0
Seriously , do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms ? 	0
Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school , and me paying for BOTH types of education . 	0
A 2009 study by professors at UCLA ' s Graduate School of Education & Information Studies presented data that graduates of all-girls ' schools show stronger academic orientations , especially in math and computer skills , and higher standardized tests scores , than their coed counterparts . 	0
But there was actually a gross violation of the third commandment by the U . S . Supreme Court a year earlier . 	0
When asking friends about whether they preferred public or private schooling for their children I got varied responses : some moved to be near a good public school , others sent their children to private schools because they wanted better discipline and to give them a social and professional head-start for when they left school , and one had tried both and saw pros and cons in each system . 	0
Then there are the fees for education . 	0
On the other hand , when your child excels in a particular area , such as music , languages or sports , or you want your child to have a spiritual education , it might be worth considering schools that have a curriculum focusing on those subjects . 	0
Most of those are private . 	0
Debate constantly rages about public funding of private schools , regardless of the school ’ s wealth raised from fees and donations . 	0
Money will definitely be an issue for us to consider when it comes to deciding which school our sons will attend . 	0
Public schooling is by-and-large free , with voluntary annual fees at around several hundred dollars . 	0
Private schooling costs thousands of dollars . 	0
When all the evidence for public and private schooling is boiled down , I think the most important factors are sending your children to a school where they are safe , secure and will receive a good education from high calibre teachers . 	0
There are schools in both the public and private systems where these factors are paramount , so it is up to us as parents to find the school that ticks as many of our boxes as possible . 	0
Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education . 	0
It ' s just like everything else the government has involvement with , failure ! ! 	0
He began to start not caring about school itself , he was very bored . 	0
I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School . 	0
I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level . 	0
Many conversations with the Principal and teachers . 	0
I made 7 . 50 / hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school . 	0
It was the best investment I had made . 	0
Or recite over and over " there is no God ? " 	0
And so , some may argue that single-sex education promotes gender-issued stereotypes . 	0
After just two weeks , the researchers reported that children who had the teacher using sex-specific language played less with children of the other sex . " 	0
My proposed solution would be to create co-ed , public schools that separate the sexes for the subjects of math and science ( debatably the two hardest , most demanding subjects taught in high school and the subjects that evoke the stereotype threat ) and create co-ed environments for all the other subjects . 	0
At the end of the day is it up to the parents : sacrifice your child ' s appreciation and cooperation with the opposite sex for a more specialized , concentrated academic environment ? 	0
This utopian schooling system would essentially provide the best of both worlds . 	0
Then , teachers could focus on targeting the needs for each sex when it comes to math and science , and incorporate both males and females for all other aspects of high school life . 	0
As a former educator , I believe that every child deserves equal access to education in the least restrictive environment possible . 	0
Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher ' s hands are tied by politically correct nonsense . 	1
These hardly constitute the totality of private schools in this country . 	0
So before drawing any definitive conclusions , we need to know how other private schools compare . 	0
Perhaps a study by Luis Benveniste , Martin Carnoy and Richard Rothstein provides an answer . 	0
They concluded that " the social , cultural , and economic backgrounds of the parents and the community in which the school was located seemed to be the main determinant of variation , much more so than a school ' s public or private character or , within the latter group , whether it was religious or secular " ( All Else Equal , RoutledgeFalmer , 2003 ) . 	0
In short , they operate entirely differently . 	0
Therefore , I ' ll go a step farther . 	0
Even when socioeconomic factors are controlled , I don ' t think it ' s fair to compare private schools with public schools . 	0
I also hasten to note that most of the schools in the Lubienskis ' study were religious schools . 	0
We live in between two very highly-regarded public schools , and he will probably attend the local primary school as it is walking distance from our house and many of his friends from day care will be going there too . 	0
AND , then other schools down the line , like The Freshman Academy , are forced to spend their limited resources undoing the damage done by single-sex classes rather than , again , implementing proven techniques to expand academic achievement . 	0
I wasn ' t equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he " broke " really easily either , and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life , until the support got there . 	0
Where does that child get the best education ? 	0
What matters is what is best for that child ' s personality ? 	0
In all honesty , it does not matter which avenue of education grants the best socialization . 	0
You don ' t sit next to them everyday , so you make time to spend with them no matter where they live . 	0
Deep connections are encouraged because you must go out of your way to see your friends . 	0
Some families homeschool year round , taking a month off between semesters to visit family and friends who live out of state . 	0
The opportunities to socialize quite likely outnumber those of public school because of the flexible time schedules . 	0
There is football , cheerleading , sign language , music , etc . There are field trips , playdates , study groups , Bible studies , conferences ( for all ages , not just the parents ) , and the list goes on . 	0
You know the rules , so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government , you need to respect the Constitution . 	0
Carry your Bible and pray if you want , but do it privately . 	1
I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others , especially the rights of children . 	0
The teach in a private school or don ' t teach . 	0
All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped . 	0
Not so with Bible thumping literalists . 	0
But much of it is mythology . 	0
Then you can continue to worship your silly book . 	0
Talk to your child about the routine in kindergarten and give him or her a schedule using pictures or words , depending on your child ’ s reading level . 	0
Ask the teacher if you can take photos of the room . 	0
” See if you can meet the teacher before September . 	0
And there are many ways ( beyond the myriad children ’ s books on the subject ) to help prepare your child . 	0
He was fine , and somehow thrived . 	0
I sobbed when I dropped our son off on his first day—not delicate weeping , but chest-heaving sobs . 	0
As with so many things in parenting , you can only be so prepared . 	0
The more your child and you know , the more comfortable everyone will be when starting this new chapter . ” 	0
only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man . 	0

hi . i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools . 	1
i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation . 	0
invite the Lord in and watch the transformation . 	0
prayer should be done openly and privately . 	0
please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence . 	1
I mean why not ? 	0
I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone ? 	0
In Canada , no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service , and going to school . 	0
I didn ' t . 	0
Did you know that schools are still legally required to make children perform acts of Christian worship in schools ? 	0
Which is why it came as something of a shock to read today that " the vast majority of schools are flouting the law by failing to stage a daily Christian assembly " . 	0
I had no idea . 	0
Parents can opt their kids out , but the children themselves have no say in the matter . 	0
Apparently , under the 1944 Education Act , it is required that schools provide “ broadly Christian worship ” every schoolday . 	0
I vaguely remember some at primary school , but that was a CofE-run establishment so it ' s hardly surprising . 	0
I was surprised to learn that , because when I was at secondary school – a reasonably ordinary comprehensive in Oxford – there was , to my memory , not a single prayer assembly in the five years I was there . 	0
Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation ' s , this is hardly a new situation . 	0
I left school a dozen years ago . 	0
Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem , because their Holy day is Saturday , also a day when there is no school . 	0
I don ' t know . 	0
It ' s certainly better than letting religion brainwash your children , which seems to be the other alternative . 	0
Christians , this is not a time to bring up the ‘ if prayer should be in schools ’ debate , because it ’ s a worthless cause . 	0
Instead , let ’ s teach people what it means to pray , even if that means not being seen at all . 	0
You don ’ t need to have your prayer mandated by schools or government , but you also don ’ t need to draw attention to yourself while praying . 	0
Done ! 	0
Prayer that doesn ’ t change the one praying isn ’ t prayer either . 	0
When prayer left the schools it reminded the church that prayer is the Christian ’ s responsibility and not the governments . 	0
It made parents , Sunday school teachers and pastors teach the students what prayer really was , and it is a lot different than some recited sentences once a day or scenes in the smoking section . 	0
It made us rethink what prayer should look like , and rethink what Jesus meant when he said prayer shouldn ’ t be on the street corners making scenes but in our rooms in private . 	0
" The student will develop a persona that they are always bigger , better , and have the upper hand , which might be challenging in their future , " she said . 	0
This is a large developmental gap when trying to get through the state standard curricula , " said Vela . 	0
There are mixed results on whether redshirting is helpful for the child in the long run . 	0
" Even though most school districts want the child to be at least at the age of five , the cut-off date for joining differs according to school district and state , " said Vela . 	0
Effects are highest for low income students and males . " 	0
Redshirting poses challenges not only to children but to teachers and parents . 	0
Alternately , estimates suggest that entering kindergarten early may also have detrimental effect on future outcomes . 	0
They are dealing with children of ages ranging between four and a half and six and a half . 	0
" The teacher is mostly impacted by it . 	0
The philosophy involves bringing support services to the child within the classroom instead of taking the student to the services , and stipulates only that the child will benefit from being in the classroom . 	0
The Special Education Advisor blog defines mainstreaming as “ selective placement of special education students in one or more ‘ regular ’ education classes . ” 	0
You know who else wants those things ? 	0
Philosophies and policies for carrying out the law vary , though . 	0
The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they ' re urging citizens to vote yes . . . . even though they just approved $150 , 000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field . 	0
Inclusion , the philosophy Adelman prefers , is defined by SEA as “ the commitment to educate each child , to the maximum extent appropriate , in the school and classroom he or she would otherwise attend . ” 	0

As Edmund Burke , correctly noted in 1795 , " All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . " 	0
Whenever the opportunity arises to support the public acknowledgement of God by prayer ( or any other means ) , it benefits all of society to take a vocal stand . 	0
As with all truths , this is still applicable today . 	0
Our nation was founded on the freedom to publicly acknowledge God ' s existence . 	0
The situation has become so absurd that congressional prayers cannot be voluntarily read in a school building . 	0
Our experiment with replacing affirmation of God ' s existence with atheistic humanism has been a dismal failure . 	0
Allowing prayer in schools will improve , not detract from a student ' s understanding of the universe . 	0
It is hard to find out things that are good about co-ed schools and bad things about single sex schools 	0
That is why I am doing this , because of one of my classes . 	0
Single sex schools are not good because they do not give you the same oppertunity to us as a co-ed schools do . . . you shoulkd post some things for debate teams . 	1
I think sometimes we are just unrealistic . 	0
They can mainstream them in sports and electives for socialization . 	0
Guess what , they are ridiculed and picked on and continuie to act out cause they thin the other students are laughing " with them " . 	0
Also , sometimes ability and IQ are not the issue , social and bahavior are . 	0
If not , they need to be tracked in a class that tailors to thier needs . 	0
If a student can show in increased performance in a higher level mainstream class even with resource , great . 	0
Really , I think we need to actually offer individualized education . 	0
And I also see the government abuse for both sides of the spectrum . 	0
If you want you children to get a good education , private is the only way to do it ! 	1
That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes . 	0
And no I don ' t feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget . 	0
The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art , playing etc . If done by parents with the right mindset , education levels and resources , I cannot see the problem . 	0
Although IDEA became law more than two decades ago , its implementation remains spotty . 	0
The government , teachers unions and political correctness has killed them . 	0
He points out that , “ the World Court , for example , presumably the new fountain of justice , or a prototype of the socialist dream of world government , has no provision for ’ taking the name of God ’ – no oath . ” 	0
I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others , but mainstream is not the way . 	1
Correction . . . worked hard and made sacrifices to afford PRIVATE school . 	0
The people who are demanding " Tolerance " are the biggest hypocrites of them all . 	0
All of this is avoided at most private schools . 	0
That is what is wrong . 	0
They have a Gay Straight Alliance club , but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as " intolerant " which is complete BS . 	0
Final lesson ? 	0
You ’ ll always be judged for pretty much any parenting decision , so figure out what works best for your family and go with it . 	0
Benedikt ’ s argument stands on shaky legs and seems fueled solely by judgement ( which she admits ) rather than exploring actual , attainable solutions for improving the public school system . 	0
But , this seems par for the course when it comes to the “ Mommy Wars ” : Instead of focusing on real solutions and changes in harmful infrastructure , judgement is tossed about like it will bring magical results ( beyond anger and defensiveness ) in its wake . 	0
I have been advised to put my money in private schools , or else save it for attorneys later . 	0
Yes , there were some quite handsome ones that my eye would wander to in class , but not enough to distract me from my work , have me expelled for poor grades and end up a delinquent on the street . 	0
Once I switched schools , I found myself with valuable – and what I ’ m sure to be life long – friendships with the boys I sat with in class . 	0
The shock of all of a sudden being in a class with boys upon entering college must be just as scary as leaving home on the collegiate journey ! 	0
How can that be successfully done when you are singularly interacting with only girls in an educational environment ? 	0
I really felt if I had stayed , I would have been unprepared for life after high school , socially speaking . 	0
Well , smart child , smart decisions = successful in a co-ed school ! 	0
Isn ’ t that the fear of parents ? 	0
And look at that , not pregnant ! 	0
What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school . 	0
She always felt she could succeed and did . 	0
We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in , so keeping her mind busy wasn ' t a problem . 	0
She is now a lawyer , who graduated in 2011 , president of the law school bar association , hired right out of school and doing very well . 	0
We kept our middle child back one year . 	0
She turned 5 in early September , but our thought was emotionally , she wasn ' t ready , so she started at 6 . 	0
I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked " You ' re an engineer , like on a train ? " and " How do I hook this to the computer ? " 	0
( speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class , with film ) 	0
I am a product of private school vs the rather run down public school around the corner from where I grew up . 	0
I later worked in an after school science program in public schools . 	0
I can attest , that if I went to these schools , I would not have been there to test these kids after school . 	0
The only way my parents could have fixed it , as the author claims would have happened , is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves . 	0
On the other side Homechoolers , depending on where you live and possibly how you are homeschooled , have homeschooling groups which not only have a large group of people , though usually smaller thatn the public school , but have the freedom of doing things togethermore often , Time schedules are more flexible and if you really wanted to you could skip a whole day of school in the middle of the wek just to hand out eith people . 	0
This point may actually lead to a superiorty in certain areas on one side or the other 	0
Where you could study the World in Highschool , , I might spend two years just to get an overview of the United States History in college . 	0
Another point to be made is your peers , if your a introvert , than it doesn ' t really matter which school you go to on this point , If you are an extrovert then here are the facts : when public school was created , many people grasped it to recieve a free education and now it is a part of everyday life , at least it is in the United States , that means that there are a lot of poeple in public school and so it would be great for an extrovert . 	0
Salomone also states that single-sex schooling for promotes interest for boys in humanities courses and that boys ’ feel more at ease because they do not feel societal pressures to be male . 	0
Challenge school committees to reconsider whether standardized testing in the lower elementary grades is a good idea . 	0
When my daughter has a 4 year window in HS to succeed or not to succeed , I don ' t have time to drive the change that typically take years . 	0
That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it . 	0
I don ' t disagree the author about the parents driving change but guess what ? 	0
grades say " the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can ' t concentrate / work . 	0
And the teachers can ' t do anything about it . " 	0
I have students in both private and public schools . 	0
When I heard my daughter ( in 8th grade at a public school ) , who has to work very hard to get slightly above avg . 	0
You don ’ t have to believe it but it ’ s true . 	0
Every knee will bow and toung confess that JESUS is LORD . 	0
Try reading the BIBLE and see what it says . 	0
Just because you don ’ t believe something doesn ’ t mean it doesn ’ t exist . 	0
Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control . 	0
The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation . 	0
Wow anyone who does not believe prayer should be in school has not studied history . 	0
This lady is something else . 	0
First of all let me say , my children attend a private school . 	0
Our district schools are less than admirable . 	0
Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood , it is clear that our district schools have issues . . . financially and educationally . 	0
I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it ? 	0
I ' m not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools . 	0
I ' m still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district . . . whether I agree with it or not ! 	0
Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year . 	0
While the 60 Minutes piece suggested that some parents hold children back from kindergarten to gain competitive advantages , Dr . Densmore pointed out that many parents are responding to the shift in what kindergarten is . 	0
Really ? 	0
The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent ’ s sign , that the children can be disciplined . 	0
It is to learn and become educated and become the successful people that we all know they can be . 	0
Forcing your religion on someone else is wrong and if your faith is not strong enough to withstand any of the statements above without you becoming frustrated or enraged , then maybe you should visit your local religious establishment and pray for open mindedness and patience . 	0
Thank you for your time . 	0

As mentioned in a study by Mael ( 1998 ) coeducation classrooms and schools reflect real life and prepare youths for gender interactions and society more so than a single-sex school would , it could also reduce sex stereotypes . 	0
There are MANY issues with how public education is formed , and the parents sending their kids to private school , are not going to make a difference . 	0
We all learned as young women the hard-to-measure notion that females can be leaders in any area just by looking around us at our peers . 	0
I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed , they tell you that there school might not be right for you . 	0
I don ' t think we should pretend it couldn ' t happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is , in itself , highly damaging . 	0
