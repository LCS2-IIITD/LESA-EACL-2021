It is are easy and usable . 	1
In my point of view , listening to music , exercising , and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress . 	1
In conclusion , there are many ways to reduce the stress . 	0
These could relieve me from stress . 	0
A way to do meditation is that I just sit down , close my eyes , and count my breath . 	0
Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment , and it take few minutes . 	0
when I have many things to think about , and this make me stress , I will do meditation . 	0
Third , meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress . 	1
And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind . 	1
If you have a good company in office , it is certainly a blessing . 	0
After all , you spend most of your day at office . 	0
This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships . 	0
Finally , the co-workers should believe in fellowship . 	1
Because I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
In conclusion , experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person . 	1
This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life . 	0
Consequently , I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life . 	0
These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person . 	1
Moreover , these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life . 	0
Besides , experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health . 	0
It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information . 	0
There are international and local news channels like BBC , CNBC , Etv Gujarati , Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings . 	0
By watching TV , children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities . 	1
For example , Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly , sports events like cricket , football can teach leadership skills , team building skills , communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs . 	0
Children can effectively learn from watching television 	0
TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it . 	0
But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth . 	1
If children spend too much time in front of TV , it will negatively impact their health and study . 	1
But on other hand , watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health . 	1
For example , they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood , and also develop back pain . 	0
Experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live 	0
Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think . 	1
For example , when I go to office , I use public transport . 	0
I see many things such as traffic jam , crowded people at bus stop , and all so crowded people in buses . 	0
Thus , many people try to reduce their stress . 	0
There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress . 	0
in my opinion , reducing stress by listening to music , playing sports , and doing meditation are easy and practical ways . 	1
First of all , listening to music is a great way to relax . 	1
Best ways of reducing stress : listening to music , exercise , meditation 	0
Nowadays , we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated . 	0
Everything seem to be rush , and it have a lot of competition . 	0
These make people get stress . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
To begin with , studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems . 	1
The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted . 	1
Moreover , in terms of punishment , living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away . 	0
Secondly , capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes , life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives . 	1
In addition , execution does not resolve the consequences of crime , not to mention it could put the criminal ' s family through hardship while the pain of the victim ' s kin is never to be consoled . 	0
Although what criminals cause to the society , specifically to the victims , is indeed significantly offensive , they are humans and their lives need to be valued . 	0
First of all , it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life . 	1
However , as the society grows , human rights become more highly respected , " murdering " criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept . 	1
In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred , it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence . 	0
Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries . 	0
Capital punishment is necessary or not ? 	0
People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition . 	0
Therefore , lives in the old days is easier than today . 	1
Children should grow up in a big city ! 	0
I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . 	0
He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . 	0
Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training . 	0
In addition , the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination , which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan . 	0
The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries . 	0
Benefits of students ' unpaid work 	0
To begin with , students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to . 	1
In this essay , I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies , and then I would draw a conclusion at the end . 	0
As a result , students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation . 	0
In most school curriculums , the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom . 	0
As for the companies , the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money . 	0
For this reason , the internship , although without pay , can give them the experiences that money cannot buy . 	0
To sum up , although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest , I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest . 	1
Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art . 	0
I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings , but , with exhaust fumes and acid rain , we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs . 	0
Finally , conservation leads us to a higher standard of living . 	1
According to statistics , 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet . 	0
Further , by means of some communication tools , it has become very easy to make new friends . 	0
However , the other side of the coin is that , by communicating via Internet or phone , we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully , because during such conversations , some of our words can make a completely different sense . 	0
In this sense , Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends . 	1
By way of conclusion , I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable . 	1
As a result , the rate of divorces is increasing day by day . 	1
Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars , and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities . 	0
In conclusion , although technological progress causes corresponding problems , it still provides us with much more advantages . 	1
People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas , and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions . 	0
This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment . 	0
The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society , especially in high level such as college or university . 	0
Some people argue that this may lead to ' social division ' , when someone with high education refuses to do the called ' low jobs ' , but actually it gives no harm to the whole community . 	0
Secondly , university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes . 	1
It ’ s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city . 	1
For this point , they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure . 	0
Another function that all zoos serve relates to education . 	0
Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos . 	1
First of all , zoos are fascinating places of entertainment . 	0
Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment . 	0
Over the time , there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals . 	0
Do zoos serve any useful function ? 	0
It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos . 	0
Moreover , some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct . 	0
The reasons to be illustrated are follows . 	0
However , from my perspective , students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam . 	1
For example , I love Physics . 	0
Firstly , the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject . 	1
Though out the last decade , the load of the university students has been constantly increasing . 	0
It is not necessary for university students to attend classes 	0
There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam . 	0
There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam . 	0
And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics . 	0
But I don ' t like electronics , because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world . 	0
Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . 	0
My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . 	0
Because most people they contact with are also students . 	0
First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . 	0
So , they can teach students many things about adult life . 	1
However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . 	0
Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . 	0
The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it 	0
There are some reasons can support my view . 	0
If students want to get used to the society quickly , it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs . 	1
This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent , and they both have better ability in the specific aspect . 	0
Furthermore , it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender , and that does not conform to students ' personality traits and mental development . 	1
Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act , and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases . 	0
For instance , there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world . 	0
Many boys are interested in science and technology , while a number of girls like to learn literature , education and arts . 	0
Besides , girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication , such as teacher , singer and interpreter . 	0
We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject 	0
There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty . 	0
Personally , I do not agree the viewpoint , because many different characters exist between male and female students . 	1
On one hand , boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality . 	1
When we talk about student , we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college . 	0
Part time job for teenage students 	0
However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . 	0
In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . 	0
The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job . 	1
In my view , it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student and this is for two reasons . 	1
For example , when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year . 	0
Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words . 	0
I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework . 	0
As i had to spend some of my time in my job , therefore , i had to manage my time efficiently . 	0
If they do not try their best , their protection can be halted and waste of money . 	0
In addition , the preservations need a long time to gather , restore all information as well as train in the educational centre . 	0
All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those . 	0
In a nutshell , I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible . 	1
Although governments invest money on doing that , it is hard to gain the good results . 	0
On the other hand , there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages . 	1
These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular . 	0
As evidence of this , there are a few people , particularly the youngsters , do not pay attention on collecting and studying those . 	0
Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way ? 	0
It ' s obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years . 	0
This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film . 	0
From my point of view , I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors , emotions & study . 	1
In the first place , children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best . 	0
Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs . 	0
Imagine an actor who is a child ’ s favorite is doing violent roles . 	0
Meanwhile , human beings are very sensitive , especially of youngsters . 	0
In modern life , zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers . 	1
Besides , recently , zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature , taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity . 	1
On the other hand , there are , however , people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals . 	1
Being confined , animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented . 	0
In their opinion , zoos are some kind of prisons and it ' s so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons . 	0
From my point of view , I agree with the first group . 	0
Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting . 	1
Everyone has happy moments during their life . 	0
School memories 	0
In my opinion , childhood is the happiest time of a person ' s life . 	1
These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood . 	0
They do not have to worry about bills , jobs , how would their life be in the future . 	0
First , in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood . 	1
A child ' s daily life is school , playing and sleeping . 	0
They just worry about two things : to have fun , learn and be happy . 	0
I could adapt this method to use my real life . 	0
It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society . 	0
When others are still struggling in preparing their resume , one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process . 	0
Some may argue that as time is different , the condition of job market is completely different . 	0
Therefore , choosing a job similar to one ' s parents ' is not always a correct decision . 	1
Nevertheless , since parents have worked in tens of years , they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry . 	0
They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children . 	1
For instance , they know which company has better welfare or provides better education . 	0
Moreover , their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies . 	0
Therefore , I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors . 	0
Finally , beside all above mentioned items , the study of youngsters shall always been controlled . 	0
On the other hand , he has to study for the exam . 	0
This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory . 	0
Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that an apartment is more expensive . 	1
Both options have their advantages and disadvantages . 	0
After considering the level of freedom , the studying conditions and the economic factor , if I had to choose , I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories . 	1
Apartments vs dormitories at university 	0
Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city . 	0
You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want . 	0
An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student . 	0
First , an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory . 	1
While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules , in the apartment you set your own rules . 	0
There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way . 	1
For example , I could improve the way that I solve problems , improve how I take care of my health , and improve to plan my life for future . 	0
For example , in math class , the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step . 	0
Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem . 	0
What is more , it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more . 	0
It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world . 	0
Several languages are in danger of extinction 	0
But the others do not believe it is possible . 	0
Some people , therefore , harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them . 	0
First and foremost , it is easy to realize that languages , especially oral language , are a quite major part of culture of a country . 	0
In my opinion , this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue . 	0
The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional , customs and habitants do not exist . 	0
It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country . 	0
I agree with this opinion to some extent , but when it comes to the trend , no one can predict it correctly . 	0
The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash , so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more . 	0
In my opinion , life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons . 	1
There are many different opinions regarding world culture . 	0
Opinions regarding world culture 	0
However , in my view , a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons . 	1
Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture . 	0
Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data , and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint . 	0
Firstly , most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology . 	1
Secondly , new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world . 	1
For example , students who are studying in Iran use the same software , Microsoft , to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students . 	0
For example , many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries . 	0
Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries , and students are being encouraged to study in this field . 	0
Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	0
Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . 	0
Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . 	0
For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . 	0
However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . 	0
Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . 	0
Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . 	0
Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . 	1
Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . 	1
Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . 	1
When I want to go to somewhere , I try to find the way to reach to destination . 	0
Last but not least , corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors . 	0
For the reasons mentioned above , I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves . 	1
North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that , technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one . 	0
For example , robots , automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks , interpreters , security services , retails and specially in manufacturing companies . 	0
Thus many people ' s jobs are now at high stake . 	0
The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs . 	1
You set your own schedules . 	0
In the other hand , living in a dormitory , and being surrounded by students also has some advantages , like being able to get help with any academic issues from them . 	0
This is only partially true , you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper . 	0
Transportation is another issue , you have to go to and return from the university everyday . 	0
You could choose to use public transportation , a cheaper option , or to have a car . 	0
The car is an expensive option , but also offers freedom of schedule and destination . 	0
Lastly , the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don ' t have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories . 	1
A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times . 	0
Since in an apartment you don ' t have a roommate , you won ' t have this problem , and as a result you would be able to concentrate better . 	0
For the same reason , you won ' t have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music , bring friends over , or study late at night . 	0
The first reason is life is simple in the past . 	0
Nowadays , all humans compete together . 	0
Since world population getting higher , competition is getting fierce . 	0
If you are not able to handle your jobs , then someone will replace you right away . 	0
People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology 	0
The life today is totally different from half centuries before . 	0
Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems ; however it also deprives of some things that we had . 	0
In short , although both sides have their equally valid arguments , I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education , at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced . 	1
This is where the computer proves to be incompetent . 	0
Therefore , in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes , also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services . 	0
Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money . 	0
Secondly , another advantage of small towns is living costs . 	1
Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then , in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities . 	0
However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress . 	0
In conclusion , I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress , because of better weather conditions and also , better relationship within a town . 	1
In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities . 	0
To summarize , higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons . 	1
America , for example , has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil . 	0
Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support , other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them . 	0
Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters , both politically and financially . 	1
However , it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues , making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars . 	1
First , when students learn facts more in school , they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations . 	0
As a case in point , more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts . 	0
As a result , they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better . 	1
Second , it would improve students ' social behavior . 	1
Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students , I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives . 	1
In the following , I will state my reasons for this choice . 	0
Benefits of students doing extra jobs 	0
In present day and age , students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university . 	0
This phenomenon , although in some extents , are proved to have negative effects , I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages . 	0
In this essay , some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained . 	0
It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs . 	0
Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities . 	0
In addition , that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities . 	0
As a result , students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience . 	0
Moreover , having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation . 	1
Secondly , students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones . 	1
For example , instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city . 	0
Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . 	0
Second , a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world . 	0
So , with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not . 	1
Of course , it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places . 	0
However , no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet . 	0
I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . 	0
People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can ' t meet every place . 	1
It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health . 	0
In this way , this won ' t be a problem at all . 	0
To sum up , students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say . 	1
To boost their sales and win over customers , companies pour a great amount of money into advertising . 	0
Most of the time , it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product . 	1
By which I mean , huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product . 	0
The co-workers should be cooperative with one another . 	0
If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes . 	0
I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious . 	0
Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not . 	0
Some important characteristics of a co-worker 	0
At work , you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment . 	0
However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . 	0
Therefore in my view , a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship . 	1
We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace . 	0
In conclusion , while there some people live in a pretty good condition , it is only a minority . 	1
Today , we are able to read the news all over the world , to chat with people through the Internet , or to travel around the world by planes ; however , it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life . 	0
If we cannot react properly and immediately , then we will be in a vulnerable situation . 	0
Thus , the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today . 	1
The third reason is that the pace of life . 	1
Everyday , I walk on hard roads , breath in polluted air , and live in a limited space . 	0
What ' s worse , it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases . 	0
Second , the environment today is serious damaged . 	0
Looking out the windows , what I see isn ' t sky , trees or mountains , but is coldly high buildings . 	0
Besides , dancing could show how civilization of that culture is . 	0
Moreover , people use dancing to entertain themselves . 	0
So dancing is important in every culture . 	1
Moreover , in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits . 	0
Regardless of some exceptions , it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities . 	1
Living in smal towns 	0
Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors . 	0
Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas , whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town . 	0
I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages , such as good weather , a healthy life and better facilities . 	1
Firstly , the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items . 	0
One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town . 	0
Also , in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic . 	0
Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness . 	0
This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues . 	0
If I worked in the different field from my father , I would have faced much difficulty than I do now . 	0
Choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career 	0
When choosing a job , one need to consider it thoroughly . 	0
So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
For example , electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years . 	0
With people raising their awareness of the green economy , the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients , which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today , triggering sales . 	0
If a firm is environmentally conscious , it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment , which can boost productivity . 	0
Furthermore , taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies . 	1
On the other hand , without the requirement of environmental preservation , the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs , being a hurdle to the economic development . 	0
Therefore , it may spur its economic development . 	0
On the other hand , I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources , technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas . 	0
Therefore , I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously . 	1
It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future . 	0
Lastly , doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation . 	1
Indeed , high studying tuition , added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students . 	0
By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation , then students ' confidence could be significantly gained . 	0
Also , working conditions require students the independency in thinking , working , and solving problems , which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities . 	0
In conclusion , I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . 	1
By taking on an extra job , students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience , confidence and accommodation . 	1
With the money they earn from extra jobs , which normally is not much , those difficulties could be partially solved . 	0
Moreover , that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life . 	1
This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive . 	0
For example , in earlier times , people didn ' t leave for faraway places , because they could easily get lost . 	0
But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative . 	0
Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone , while complex ones should be only handled by the best people , who start their career from the best institutions . 	0
To sum thing up , I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school , but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students . 	1
Ultimately , this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society . 	0
I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives . 	1
However , it is had some demerits on their social lives . 	1
Modern forms of communication ; ' electronic letter ' 	0
Undoubtedly , the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better , which help people to interact to others , such as email and messaging without limitation time . 	0
Another perspective , using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable . 	0
It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere , so they do not do much social live interactions with others . 	0
Mentioned to societies life style , they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had . 	0
Obviousness , there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook , also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time . 	1
The consequence of this case made some people become geek , as too much of using email and messaging , without direct contacts . 	1
However , people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship , meet them and talk by face to face directly . 	0
Moreover , after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents . 	0
As you can see , part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially . 	0
In sum , I am sure ; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students . 	0
They will argue , it can destruct students from their study . 	1
However , as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result ; therefore , i believe part time job will be good for students . 	1
Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future . 	0
Consequently , dancing are the part of people belief . 	1
Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced , the rain would come . 	0
Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture . 	0
Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe . 	0
The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years 	0
Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not . 	0
Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . 	0
While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . 	0
Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . 	0
But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future . 	1
The following reasons will present my points . 	0
First of all , since the public transportation has improved , it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus . 	1
This will improve the quality of both universities and students , thus placing people in positions which suit them most . 	1
In conclusion , I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children . 	1
Sometimes , students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences . 	0
Many times , students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels , or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades . 	0
And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics , I could not pass the entire part of physics , and I will fail the exam over and over again . 	0
But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics . 	0
And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics . 	0
Luckily , in our university , you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach . 	0
Secondly , if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam , students are highly likely to leave uncultivated . 	1
And at last , I took the electronics again and pass the exam . 	0
And the students will have nothing to do in the campus . 	0
If one fail most of the exam , it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes . 	0
The academic achievement will decline . 	0
Then he or she will play online games days and nights . 	0
By casting famous singers in their television advertisement , motorcycles or clothes for example , sales increase significantly since youngsters , as the target consumers , love celebrities . 	0
High sales reflect power of advertising and not the real need 	0
Nowadays , we can see advertisements everywhere , from television set to posters on the streets . 	0
I tend to agree with this view . 	0
However , a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended . 	0
To sum up , it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals . 	1
However , I am convinced that it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind . 	1
It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . 	0
Some religion , such as Buddha , believes that animals were human being in their previous life , so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings . 	0
Secondy , relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet . 	0
To begin with , nowadays , to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever . 	0
From my point of view , this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks . 	1
By means of some software such as Skype , MSN , Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want . 	0
In conclusion , I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study , emotions and behaviors . 	1
Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present , it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete . 	1
Therefore , if these scenes are in TV , they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child . 	1
Nowadays , the Earth has become like a small village . 	0
For instance , dying is always a disappointing happening . 	0
Furthermore , killing is worse . 	0
In this condition , because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it , it is obvious that he wouldn ’ t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly . 	0
Hence , the study of a youngster would affected terribly . 	1
For example , a child watches a frightening movie . 	0
Technology impact on people 	0
In the course of the last hundred years , the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology . 	0
I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning , which makes them do the best to improve themselves . 	0
Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
True function of a university 	0
Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake , it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources . 	0
This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health . 	0
Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer . 	0
Firstly , health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular . 	1
It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect . 	1
Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue , others think it is much beyond that . 	0
Recent years , however , has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians . 	0
Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family ' s meals all around the world . 	0
Since the dawn of time , human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources . 	0
Vegetarianism - why some people are choosing to become vegetarian ? 	0
Furthermore , it can be replaced by a life sentence . 	1
In conclusion , although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community , I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane . 	1
Thus , many people are executed for the crime they did not commit , which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system . 	0
Juries are also humans , they may lack of discretion . 	0
Therefore , a government ' s role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people ' s lives . 	0
I feel that after working out , I am easily to fall asleep . 	0
Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health . 	0
These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress . 	0
Thus , after work , I always do exercise , and jogging is my favorite sport . 	0
Second , another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise . 	1
For instance , I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time . 	0
I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me . 	0
Consequently , I feel happy when I listen music . 	0
These make me stress . 	0
So that I always listen music from my mp3 player . 	0
I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me . 	0
To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him . 	0
They should not act on suspicion . 	0
This is a very important aspect in the work environment . 	0
Therefore , I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment . 	1
The co-workers need to trust each other . 	1
When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse . 	0
From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility . 	0
However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me . 	0
But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department . 	0
I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions . 	1
This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers . 	0
As a result , people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition . 	1
A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family . 	0
But with the recent recession , almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall . 	0
People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living . 	0
However , a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security . 	0
People are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification 	0
The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century . 	0
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system . 	0
Moreover , the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment . 	0
The official term of it is named " Technological Unemployment " . 	0
Lastly , experiences are also change to plan for my future life . 	1
For example , I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life . 	0
Secondly , Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself . 	1
For instance , reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy . 	0
Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time . 	0
I could find a better way to solve problems . 	0
So that , I can have a good health . 	0
This experience teach me to aware my health . 	0
Thus , I am always buy a quality food such as organic food . 	0
This food are not have chemical . 	0
I will give reasons to support my opinion . 	0
And also dancing to entertain people . 	0
For example , some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life . 	0
First , dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe . 	0
In every country , people do dance for fun , for entertrain , and for decrease a stress . 	0
Dancing plays an important role in a culture . 	0
Since having these products shows their status , the quality obviously is not relatively important . 	0
However , despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated , it is also true that it plays and important role economically . 	1
Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television . 	1
No matter how appealing the advertisements are , we should be able to make the decision on our own . 	0
Otherwise the market may be monopolistic , and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective . 	0
The power of advertising maybe over-rated , we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers . 	1
They introduce new products , and provide various choices , not to mention they are often visually enjoyable , since they aim to grab your attention . 	0
Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels , creates a fair environment for commercial competition . 	0
The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society . 	1
In my opinion , there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health . 	0
In conclusion , a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being . 	1
In addition to what mentioned , medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind . 	1
In conclusion , in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places , technologies facilities , better education and medical services . 	1
But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation , because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly . 	1
Every technology has it ’ s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology . 	0
So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns . 	1
Unlike middle school or high school , university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge . 	0
First , focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality . 	1
Big city vs small town 	0
I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside . 	1
The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns . 	1
Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life , because the environment that a person grow up , build the personality and his / her culture . 	1
There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants , museums , bars , sporting clubs , cinemas , theatre and etc . People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends . 	1
That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people , and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions , since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone . 	0
Better education results better career and been well paid . 	0
In fact , some students may be capable in high schools , but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones . 	0
University education should be only available for good students 	0
However , in my opinion , it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good , knowledgeable learners . 	1
Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level . 	0
Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . 	0
I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons . 	1
We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . 	0
In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	0
Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . 	1
My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . 	0
Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc . 	1
It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position . 	0
All in all , I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons . 	1
As a matter of fact , when a student understands a fact and its consequences , he or she can encounter it more confidently . 	1
In my viewpoint , concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody ' s life . 	0
Thus , if they deal more with facts , they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life . 	0
Moreover , these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts . 	0
However , I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment . 	1
In this view , the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting . 	1
As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources , advanced technologies and experience , they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards . 	0
Admittedly , some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection , thus ruining the local environments . 	0
As a result , unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen , which can put a strain on the natural resources . 	0
Besides , people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems . 	0
Currently , a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries . 	0
Economic development vs environment 	0
From my perspective , I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation . 	1
However , some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems . 	0
In conclusion , taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it . 	1
Therefore , parents should encourage students to take the part-time job . 	1
Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world . 	0
I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path . 	1
In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents ' , I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry . 	1
To conclude , both options have their advantages , but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory . 	1
Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better . 	1
Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried , this might be ended in disappointment . 	0
I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning , his improvement of ability , with regard to cooperation and express his opinion , is unpromising . 	0
knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened . 	0
Finally , of course , being without a teacher has shortcomings . 	1
Furthermore , the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction . 	0
Moreover , This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree . 	0
Secondly , in my mind , the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	1
We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself . 	0
In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years . 	1
Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students ' future lives 	0
There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not . 	0
If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically , they would not realize human ' s mind very well . 	0
They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well . 	0
Not to mention , that hasty decisions , not only goes to waste , but also , could affect the entire life of the person . 	1
To put it differently , is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed , he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs , thus , his life had taken a turn to the worst . 	0
For example : if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative , or a plan B , he could end up being unemployed , because of his speedy decision . 	0
In addition , making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity . 	1
In another word , if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn ' t have missed out on the job opening in the same firm , but at a different position . 	0
Hence , he wouldn ' t have been unemployed . 	0
Haste makes waste 	0
This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one . 	1
In my opinion , this statement is completely true , for these few reasons : For one thing , making a quick decision means that it ' s not very thought out , and that it hasn ' t been checked from all its aspects . 	0
Consequently , making quick decisions leads to probable bad results . 	1
According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association , we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed , which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered . 	0
First , conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history . 	1
If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment , I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below . 	0
Spending money on supporting art or protecting environment 	0
Furthermore , supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually . 	1
In short , the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn ' t take harsh measures now , we never will . 	0
If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars , nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change , causing flooding , drought , and an increasing amount of damaging storms . 	0
What ' s more , rising sea levels , caused by global warming , have reached a level that is threatening human ' s life in many countries . 	0
Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment , then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society . 	0
Nowadays , an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation ; therefore , sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising . 	0
This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . 	0
Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience , you won ’ t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited . 	1
If someday I have children , I ’ m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it . 	1
For example , the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign . 	0
A greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues 	0
In today ' s world , the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens . 	0
I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients . 	0
Therefore , society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients . 	1
People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology ; nevertheless , behind the glamorous facade of it , what we loss will never be returned . 	1
Because of the technology of internet and air transportation , businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions . 	0
This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue . 	0
Besides , advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard . 	1
With the improvement of medical technology , it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before , and many serious diseases are under control . 	0
Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect 	0
In the past few decades , there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals , although bringing some disadvantages to us . 	1
On one hand , the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards . 	1
Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools , which play an important role in economic activity . 	0
Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies , and this means that we could get more happiness from technology . 	0
On the other hand , the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society . 	1
To sum up , new technology has affected cultures of the world , and we can see many similarities in many cultures . 	1
For example , two days ago , I went to a Canadian restaurant , and I ate noodle , sushi , which are Chinese foods , and Greek salad . 	0
In fact , new technology has influences on educational system , jobs and foods in the world . 	1
Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture , and technology cannot affect them . 	1
This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries . 	0
In fact , cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet . 	0
This point has some merits on the surface ; however , many countries such as Canada , the USA , and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures . 	0
In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	1
Moreover , I did not have to worry about costs and other things , I just had fun and learned . 	0
For example , when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood . 	0
On the other hand , universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities , and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects . 	1
Through face-to-face communication , teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore , adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students . 	0
Admittedly , the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can . 	1
As a result , information from those sources is subject to question . 	1
Much information as the Internet may provide , most of the sources are unjustified by experts . 	0
On the other hand , critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable , there still remain certain shortcomings . 	0
Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge , ranging from visual to aural stimuli , which make learning an ever enjoyable experience , especially for children . 	0
Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information , which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate . 	1
This idea may point out to two main directions , both of which present different arguments . 	0
With the number of technological advances growing apace , it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future . 	0
Computers replace human teachers 	0
They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages . 	0
Hence I , in my class , often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem , and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher . 	0
In addition , the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework , Nevertheless , I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself . 	1
Firstly , The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies . 	1
In other words , when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out , that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly . 	0
In addition , professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge , and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study . 	0
Learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself . 	0
Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them . 	0
As for the learning by yourself , it has some certain profit . 	0
It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you , and your learning becomes more profound . 	0
For example , I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars . 	0
So , with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own . 	0
Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person . 	0
However , one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor . 	0
Moreover , he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories . 	0
For example , my father ' s best moments in his life are in his school years . 	0
There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly . 	0
In other words , childhood is , indeed , the most happiest moments in a person ' s life . 	1
Second , childhood is the period where people go to school and learn . 	0
Also , people are most creative when they were children , children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy . 	1
There you learn , to find your first love , to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun . 	0
Therefore , school memories are one of the best memories in a person ' s life . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people . 	1
I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy . 	0
For instance , I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom , king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture . 	0
Secondly , dancing can represent to civilization of that culture . 	1
All this is a civilization of their culture . 	0
The way of movement , the way that they costume and also a music while they dance . 	0
And dancing is one of that ways . 	1
Thirdly , many culture , people have many ways to entertain themselves . 	0
For example , many event , such as christmas , last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts , and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song . 	0
Both people who see and dance also have a good time . 	0
Whenever I met a difficulty , I would reach him for consulting . 	0
Because he has many experiences , I could save enormous time in finding solution . 	0
First of all , as parents are involved in the same environment , they could thus support much more to their children , such as domain knowledge and industry-related information . 	1
For example , my father is a software programmer , and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge . 	0
Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents ' job or not , different people may hold different opinions . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I think choosing the job that is similar to parents ' jobs could benefit to one ' s career . 	1
In conclusion , I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to . 	1
Besides , we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague . 	1
Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents . 	1
This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things . 	0
I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . 	0
For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . 	0
Moreover , I learn money management . 	0
This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively . 	0
From this i learned , how to manage money correctly . 	0
When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop . 	0
By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it . 	0

While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation , I strongly disagree with this notion . 	1
However , cars themselves , especially private ones , have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption . 	0
There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced . 	0
Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars ? 	0
However , taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation . 	0
Additionally , for those who have already afforded a car , there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities . 	0
Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains , buses or ferries . 	1
One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised , people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile . 	0
Consequently , people have to turn to cheaper alternatives , which might cause the abundance in goods and later on , economic crisis . 	1
To be precise , the more costly petrol is , the higher the price of necessary product : rice , meat or even vegetable . 	0
Therefore , companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation . 	1
It would affect students ' mental health to study in the environment of single gender . 	0
In conclusion , it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls , and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject . 	1
For example , a girl , who is interested in literature , is arranged into an engineering department , but she is unlikely to focus on her subject , and this also can block the girl ' s future development and career prospect . 	0
As can be seen from this , is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one . 	1
That ' s why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly , to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him . 	0
Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns . 	0
In this case , the child would imitate the actor ' s behaviors in order to look like to him . 	0
Thus , unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child ’ s behaviors . 	1
In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers . 	0
It ’ s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life . 	0
But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points . 	0
All in all , the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated . 	1
In the end , this student will become a loser in the world . 	0
And all this is due to that the university don ' t permit them to attend the class . 	0
This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system . 	0
Admittedly , the university student may don ' t reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not . 	1
