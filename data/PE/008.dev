For the above reasons , I agree that distance education can ' t replace traditional school . 	1
Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly . 	0
Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment . 	0
Instead of afraid or panic , they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes . 	0
Secondly , health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases . 	0
For example , if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age , he also keeps it when older . 	0
First of all , thank to a full health education from their childhoods , children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences . 	0
Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations . 	1
Once applied , it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments . 	0
It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment . 	1
Prevention is better than cure 	0
Children should grow up in a big city ! 	0
I have a friend that grew up in the countryside . 	0
He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university . 	0
Instead , he hardly cared about something else . 	0
For instance , Albert Einstein , one of the most competent physicians in history , devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity . 	0
If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins , it is so easy for them . 	0
Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds . 	0
No one has the right to take the life of a human ; even if he committed murder . 	0
It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being . 	0
Some people might say I am silly , but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship . 	1
However , I forgot about it just after two days , and I felt at peace with him . 	0
However , if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake , there will be no friends around you . 	0
Second , Everybody makes mistake . 	1
However , when the mistake friend made was not a big problem , we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life . 	0
I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake , we will need to end a friendship . 	0
I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life . 	1
According to a research , 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend . 	0
The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method . 	1
Although , it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children , I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs . 	0
Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual . 	0
How to learn children more efficiently 	0
Technology and its advance , to some degrees , have influenced the educational industry positively . 	0
To begin with , classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child . 	0
Thus , physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters ' skills . 	1
Yet , monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless . 	0
The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this . 	0
It ’ s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city . 	1
Through part-time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life . 	0
My friend Lisa , who is doing part-time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it . 	0
Because most people they contact with are also students . 	0
First , there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university . 	0
So , they can teach students many things about adult life . 	1
However , when students do part-time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults . 	0
Nowadays , the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger . 	0
The part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it 	0
There are some reasons can support my view . 	0
If students want to get used to the society quickly , it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs . 	1
I can prepare my schedules , guidelines , exercises and go over them all . 	0
For instance , I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone . 	0
Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons . 	1
Yet , I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more , and it helps me to build my personality . 	1
Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups . 	0
At school or university , success depends on how we study . 	0
Everyone has their method to success in life . 	0
Some students prefer to study alone 	0
In my opinion , I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone . 	0
Moreover , we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math , reading , and drawing . 	0
It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old . 	1
By way of conclusion , it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life . 	1
They have given their effort to the society so that young people , the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system . 	0
Although it is real in some aspects , I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time , so they are worth to have good care . 	0
On special dates , city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art . 	0
I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings , sculptures or artifacts . 	0
This can at least assure me that if I feel bad , city can provide a high quality help . 	0
What ' s more , cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside . 	1
A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people . 	0
I am fond of Italian food , and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city , I will definitely visit it . 	0
Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one . 	1
There a person can listen to music , make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone . 	0
All in all , the best way to judge about individuals ' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance . 	1
She asked me to stay with her till my parents come , also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable . 	0
One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys , so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home . 	0
Considering all the benefits , I would choose to live in a big city . 	1
In conclusion , while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air , big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places . 	1
The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge . 	1
The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge , not a worker with outstanding communicating skill . 	0
However , reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services . 	1
In conclusion , I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment . 	1
In addition , because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention , the government can save a lot of money for our country ' s health budget . 	0
As human resources play a key role in the development of a country , investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision . 	1
When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country , the community ' s health state will be improved remarkably . 	0
For example , vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu , smallpox , rubella so on . 	0
Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens . 	0
Therefore , it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places , and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it . 	1
This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences . 	0
The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals . 	0
Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation . 	0
Lastly , smoking does no good to the smoker himself . 	1
At this point , the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader . 	0
This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity , because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior . 	0
It spoils the smoker ' s reputation and threats other people ' s health . 	0
To conclude , smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior . 	1
It is generally believed that , the second-hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself . 	0
First of all , although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society , one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others ' health . 	0
This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it . 	0
For example , if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked . 	0
Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief . 	0
Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants or other public places 	0
In this case , I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places , and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant ' s environment , but also imposes a potential threat on others ' health . 	1
However , one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people ' s health . 	0
To my view , I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs . 	1
Yet , the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others . 	1
Besides , organization have been transformed to customers oriented . 	0
Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction . 	0
Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other , especially when conflicts arise . 	0
Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way . 	0
On the other hand , it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers . 	1
It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently . 	0
Firstly , some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer . 	1
It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job . 	0
Specifically , people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience . 	0
Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery . 	0
Qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee ' s competency of their jobs 	0
With the increased educational level of workforce , there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process . 	0
However , some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion . 	0
The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion . 	0
TV has adverse effects on friends and family 	0
I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on , he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours . 	0
Some People spend a lot of time watching television , others even eat watching television , and some others make of this media a priority . 	1
Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work , but he only let her talk during commercials . 	0
Therefore , I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family . 	1
One of this resource is television ; however television has some negative effects among some people . 	0
Nowdays there are different resources to entertain , educate and inform people . 	0
First of all , some people spend a lot of time watching television . 	1
So , she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email . 	0
As I have said , television is a great tool to learn , entertain and inform what is happening , but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority , spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television . 	1
For example , my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift . 	0
I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly . 	0
First of all , a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever . 	0
In this essay , I will present two reasons supporting my opinion . 	0
If someone remembers mistake , he or she has a closed mind . 	0
Anybody does not remember mistakes . 	0
There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship . 	0
Friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible 	0
However , I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend , although mistake is terrible . 	1
It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result . 	0
Compared with playing computers every day , doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday . 	0
Actually , most students will do the part-time job in their holiday , so it will not effect on their study . 	0
Hence , thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life . 	0
For example , Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work . 	0
However , because we do not experience it , it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be . 	0
Second , parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life . 	0
Actually , some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job . 	0
Therefore , we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be . 	1
Third , some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student ' study . 	1
Therefore , the part-time job can make people understand future life better . 	1
Also , when there is a dinner with friends , some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them . 	0
This is the time , when if they have children , they can share everything about school , a project and even concerns . 	0
Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family . 	1
Time with the family is gold , some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them . 	0
Honestly , I was in shock ! 	0
I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night . 	0
Finally , some people make the television a priority . 	1
When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking , this is not the reality in some cases . 	0
How she could say that to me ? . 	0
In conclusion , I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact . 	1
Hence , having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently . 	1
However , the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense . 	0
Last but not least , compared with teachers , parents do not have enough time to spend with their children . 	0
Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work , hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children . 	0
Thus , it was impossible for them to be a good teacher . 	1
In conclusion , teachers are the best for children ' s education . 	1
Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax . 	1
In fact , in order to develop a country , citizens must obey laws , which were imposed by the government . 	0
If people are paying taxes , that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country ' s economy . 	0
Therefore , they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen . 	1
It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity , violence , eroticism etc . I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents ; however , in the case of adults being the audience , there ' s really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art . 	1
Let ' s then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals . 	0
If the art displays unreality , the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value ; if the art reflects the reality , then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth ? 	0
It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination , exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated ; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not , it is the public ' s authority to determine how to interpret its meaning . 	0
In a word , the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified . 	0
Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth ? 	0
Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life ; however , some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government . 	0
Creative Artists 	0
One of the major concerns against freeing artists ' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society ; however , I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work . 	1
It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it ' s rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists ' will to create . 	1
Citizen ' s only responsibility is to pay taxes 	0
There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen . 	0
The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is , primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence . 	1
In my view , I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management . 	1
In addition , if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized . 	0
For example , while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses . 	0
However , for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour . 	0
For example , buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background . 	0
Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after , the Earth ' s natural resources are totally exhausted . 	0
At that time , human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources . 	0
Also , people are endangering other species ' live . 	1
Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food . 	0
Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities . 	0
For example , students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork . 	0
We can learn a lot from programs at home ; however , our computers or televisions can ' t teach us how to get along with people . 	0
Furthermore , there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization - establishes relationship with classmates . 	1
If you are the type that gets easily distracted , a distance-learning program may not be for you . 	0
Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision . 	1
Unlike traditional classes , distance education courses don ' t take place in a classroom , where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates . 	0
Second , studying at home is very different from traditional learning . 	0
Unfortunately , it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help . 	0
Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects . 	1
Moreover , they are the symbols of our nations , which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors . 	1
They can benefit us financially by developing other industries . 	1
These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city . 	1
Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on . 	0
Therefore , It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors . 	0
It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago . 	0
Secondly , the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city . 	1
They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school . 	0
Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea , personally I approve it . 	0
New high school 	0
The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students , so they can ' t get enough education . 	1
The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community . 	1
Firstly , I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education . 	1
I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community . 	1
Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition , so the students can ' t study well during the classes . 	0
Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials , repairing of the place for sport activities . 	0
For example , after many years of teaching experience , teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries , facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills . 	0
By contrast , parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way . 	0
However , in comparison to teachers , parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children ' s subjects such as mathematics and physics . 	0
Furthermore , teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children ' s communication skills . 	1
In the first place , school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education . 	1
For instance , to be able to obtain the teacher certificates , people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge . 	0
Indeed , children grow up with two important people , their parents and teachers , and both are important in children ' s development . 	0
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects . 	1
Teacher is the best option for children ' s education in some aspects 	0
Recently , there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children ' s education . 	0
Consequently , we should pay more attention to adjust people ' s behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control . 	0
On the other hand , criminal mind seems to be more related to violence . 	1
All in all , it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate . 	1
This ideal , however , doesn ' t necessarily be accomplished . 	0
That may help you expand experiences , look for your personalities and find your new talents . 	0
You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren ' t good at the things . 	0
Without doubt , the more time you spend on what you do well , the more likely to achieve something great you will be . 	0
Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal . 	0
So , I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at . 	1
If not , you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things . 	0
For instance , a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries . 	0
On the other hand , children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity , cooperation , competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms . 	0
Secondly , watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it . 	1
Therefore , teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens . 	1
Additionally , it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills . 	1
School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages . 	1
In conclusion , despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children , kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity . 	1
As a result , such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career . 	0
In conclusion , even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers , it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked . 	1
For another , mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry , possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields . 	0
In contrast , manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages . 	0
One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission . 	0
When society had problems , it could impact to a nation . 	0
Thus , government should create campaign to fill love to family . 	1
Lastly , family is a root of society . 	0
If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other , that family could have problems , If family had problems , it mean society could have problems . 	0
In conclusion , I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs . 	1
The basic needs : jobs , good environment , and love in family . 	0
For example , setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other . 	0
When family understand each other , it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble . 	0
These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people . 	1
Therefore , if a government wants to control crime in a community , it is important to manage their people ' s actions rather than gun used in violent crimes . 	1
As a result , the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself . 	0
First of all , it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime . 	1
To some extent , I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control . 	1
Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society . 	0
Gun control and increasing violence 	0
Moreover , there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world , either polices or common citizens . 	0
People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns , regardless of gun control . 	0
In fact , stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally . 	1
However , this is not as simple as it sounds . 	0
It is said that , surprisingly , he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because , at least for him , using two different soups properly was quite annoying . 	0
As a result , I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems . 	0
Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably , I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems . 	0
Then , you will motivate yourself to do more . 	0
Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them , the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience . 	1
Therefore , smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health . 	1
On the other hand , some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system . 	1
It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people . 	1
In facts , young people will be happy as their parents , grandparents are healthy . 	0
In addition , a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society . 	0
In other words , they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost . 	0
They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity . 	0
The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health . 	1
Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system , I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages . 	1
Along with the development of technologies , advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy . 	0
Improved medical care 	0
Therefore , even when we grow older , get married and then have our own families with spouses and children , parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life . 	1
Secondly , at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages , but after school we learn from our parents . 	0
In my opinion , we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school . 	0
As we were born , parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile , how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating . 	0
Moreover , when we grow bigger , they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives . 	0
I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons . 	0
Firstly , parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life . 	1
Getting the best lessons , besides our abilities to self-study , depends on our teachers a lot . 	0
There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers . 	1
Parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life 	0
Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives . 	0
When you ' re doing something well , you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it . 	0
If you keep doing what you already do well , you can be better good at it . 	0
As the example above indicates , you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well . 	1
In summary , doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better . 	1
Thus , by doing what you are good at , you will be better at it . 	1
In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city . 	0
Small town vs . Big city ( opportunities , entertainment , job places ) 	0
Big city life provides many opportunities . 	0
As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places , I think I would prefer to live in a city . 	1
Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply . 	0
First of all , it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city . 	0
At the weekends , there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis . 	1
Therefore , a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town . 	1
Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines . 	0
There are numerous bars , cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends . 	0
So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information , rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers ' taste . 	1
In conclusion , the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources . 	1
It would be helpful , however , if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures . 	0
Not only that , as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops . 	0
To illustrate this further , in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight . 	0
Today , close circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances . 	0
Use of CCTV cameras 	0
It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . 	0
They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . 	0
Even so , I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace . 	1
Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . 	0
This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced . 	0
Firstly , by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down . 	0
Besides , high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum . 	0
To conclude , CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise . 	1
This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers . 	1
Admittedly , privacies are lost with the use of these cameras . 	0
Nonetheless , safety should be put first in order to be safe . 	0
Although those above reasons are acceptable , I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job . 	0
Firstly , studying music , art or sports is also very important to students . 	0
This is understandable when labor market now has high competition ; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification . 	0
In addition , the unemployment rate is always high , so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job . 	0
Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school , I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program . 	1
Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics , physics because these subject are necessary for students ' future . 	1
Schools should only teach children the academic subject 	0
People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school . 	0
This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them . 	0
Secondly , to get a job in labor market , not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork , presentation . 	0
The financial burden of families , for instance , has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money . 	0
In the second place , the revolution in females ' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well . 	1
This is to say , the " weaker " gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men , not to mention they even perform better in some fields . 	0
Women nowadays are much more active , they may be successful businessmen , they join the political world , they become scientists and so on . 	1
Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children . 	0
To start with , the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society . 	0
This , contrary to some ideas , is a positive progress in human society from my point of view . 	1
Women have been opened up to more chances than ever . 	0
The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life , including the revolution of feminism . 	0
Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past 	0
Concerning that elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society , government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it . 	0
So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy , and this interplay seriously compromises a country ' s future development . 	0
In other words , if countries , especially the developing countries , are determined to take off , one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education . 	1
It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development . 	0
All things considered , in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles . 	1
Yet everything has it upside and downside , women should find the best way to overcome such challenges . 	0
Also , children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work . 	0
Admittedly , such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or , under many circumstances , women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives . 	1
What is more , women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration . 	0
By way of conclusion , I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work ; on the contrary , they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful . 	1
Admittedly , applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers ' economic profit . 	0
While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products , others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people ' s health condition and the society . 	0
In recent years , the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy . 	0
Advanced fertilizers and machine for farmers , good or bad ? 	0
Unlike the organic plant foods , industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals , which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently . 	0
However , high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals ' health well-being . 	1
Consequently , the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased . 	1
This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops , and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest . 	0
Moreover , excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society . 	1
In this case , consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future . 	0
For instance , I have a neighbor who are old , black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her . 	0
Second of all , there are some people who are black skin , fat and frown , nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague . 	1
We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance . 	1
From my point of view although appearance is important , personality is the most important . 	1
Individuals have two features , one of them is appearance and the other one is personality . 	0
Best way to judge about people is to be familiar with their personality - not with their look 	0
For example , some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken ; however , after getting marriage they show their real personality . 	0
First of all , there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing , therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance . 	1
I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes . 	0
Some people believes , individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person . 	0
Moreover , if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem , it is neither unethical nor immoral . 	0
If you kill a criminal , you become a criminal . 	0
Finally , with some of serious criminals , capital punishment is an easy way out . 	1
In short , crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment . 	0
Secondly , nobody has the right to take another human life . 	1
Hence , death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture . 	1
They show us how they survive , or how they defend themselves etc . By investigating about their structures , we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building . 	0
They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago . 	0
They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city . 	0
Historic buildings answer many questions , which are mysterious about our previous ancestors ; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings . 	1
In addition , they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists . 	1
The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors . 	1
It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones , but these revolutions should not include historic buildings . 	1
Replacing old buildings is important for any city but it should not affect historic houses 	0
Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city . 	1
In the other hand , historic buildings are important treasures , which provide an area to learn valuable lessons . 	0
To give an example , I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school . 	0
There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before . 	0
Higher school students should be taught how to manage money 	0
Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . 	0
Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . 	0
Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts : where more and more is known about less and less . 	0
Nevertheless , among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life . 	0
True function of a university 	0
Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise . 	0
What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for , not the employers , as students are the ones here to seek knowledge . 	0
High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons : a degree that ' s more widely accepted , gain knowledge and insight into an industry , or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field . 	0
However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university . 	0
A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge . 	1
On the other hand , universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather . 	0
It is , therefore , not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university , but instead , these must be made available when needed . 	0
To sum up , this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities , also the new educational equipment will increase the students ' enthusiasm toward studying . 	1
The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed , but I think this isn ' t a important reason for ceasing the competitions . 	0
So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment . 	1
The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate , but I think that it isn ' t a big deal . 	1
For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch . 	0
After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school , participate in different competitions . 	0
The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions . 	0
This will increase the social connections of the students . 	0
Through million years of hunting , especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite , people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct . 	0
Moreover , people , suffering from the population pressure , are expanding their living area ; consequently , the living area of other species narrowed . 	0
This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction . 	0
All in all , from discussed reasons , we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment , depleting the resource and imperiling other species ' lives . 	1
Recently , there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV . 	0
When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised , they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases . 	0
However , it is not sufficient in itself . 	0
The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising . 	1
Everyday , companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers . 	0
Advertisements affects on consumer goods 	0
Therefore , advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product . 	1
We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements . 	0
In my opinion , advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons . 	1
The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers . 	0
In conclusion , as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods , high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements . 	1
They make the product preferable . 	1
Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product . 	1
Also , the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media , the more popular the product becomes . 	0
As a result of this , the number of that product being sold will increases . 	0
The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot . 	0
Considering this fact , advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised . 	0
However , it also has to be affordable for the consumer . 	0
When a product is commonly used , it becomes trustworthy for the society , no matter what quality it is . 	0
Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product . 	0
Besides , people are draining the Earth ' s natural resources . 	1
These resources such as oil , coal are vital for human activity , therefore nowadays , the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people . 	0
Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth . 	0
However , I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet , for human are polluting the Earth ' s environment , exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species . 	1
Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed by human 	0
Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue . 	0
These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a " new " continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage . 	0
Furthermore , the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air , causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain , global warming or climate change . 	0
People are corrupting their ecosphere . 	1
In recent decades , concurrently with the increase of human consume , the waste discarded by human also multiplies . 	0
Nevertheless , it has not changed the importance of teachers ' role in classes . 	0
Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood . 	0
I hold this belief because of two main reasons , academic and social reasons . 	1
We did play video-games , but that wasn ' t our main activity . 	0
In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do . 	0
Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game , but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did . 	1
My friends and I used to play soccer , bike , climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day . 	0
Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens , while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities . 	0
Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries . 	0
Not only do they contribute much to children ' s professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world . 	1
In conclusion , taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it . 	1
Therefore , parents should encourage students to take the part-time job . 	1
Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money , what ' s more , government ' s big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide . 	1
From reasons listed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that , a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities , both are crucial on the way to a brighter future . 	1
If we lived in good environment , our life would be better . 	0
In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide , government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy . 	1
Instead of spend time with family and friends , they like to seat on a chair for hours . 	0
Second , environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it . 	0
Thus , people have a good quality life . 	0
Therefore , criminal rate were drop . 	0
When people have jobs , they did not have to steal money . 	0
So , government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide . 	0
These impact on every living creature in the world . 	0
Greenhouse effect causes of climate change . 	0
Nowaday , industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide , which caused of greenhouse effect . 	0
For instance , through taking part in a sport , students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills . 	0
Therefore , these subjects might fulfil the students ' ability . 	1
Finally , children ' s future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school , it is the result of their efforts and capacity . 	0
In conclusion , although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children , it seem to me that the effects of learning music , sports are profound . 	1
That ' s why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge . 	0
To sum up , I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment , the excellent knowledge will be of more importance . 	1
After we get a job , the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture , but in making us excellent and totally master this job . 	0
Finally , we will be rewarded with pride . 	0
Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge . 	1
Through our whole study life , undergraduate and graduate , we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job , just like an old Chinese scholar said , the essence of study is utilizing it . 	0
The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company . 	0
So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge . 	0
Because it can not only benefit our employers , but also ourselves will be rewarded . 	1
People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society . 	1
For instance , people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books . 	0
On the other hand , a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation . 	0
Indeed , if people in society have a strong bond with each other , society will become a peaceful place , where people are helping and sharing to each other . 	0
Taking everything into account , I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties , other than paying taxes . 	1
After that I understood , I had to never judge with people ' s appearance . 	0
Unfortunately , many people play role to cheat the others , and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance . 	0
This is another downside of growing up in the countryside . 	0
Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one . 	0
Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience , you won ’ t know a lot of people , there are gossips everywhere , and your life will be really limited . 	1
If someday I have children , I ’ m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it . 	1
" Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime . " 	0
Capital punishment ; 51% countries have polished death penalty 	0
In the whole world , 51% countries have polished death penalty ; even , it is at 98% in Europe . 	0
In recently years , many countries have polished the law of the death penalty . 	0
However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . 	0
Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase . 	0
Firstly , capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture . 	0
Personally , I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons . 	1
That ' s why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant . 	1
Admittedly , the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job . 	1
This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates , cooperating with other workers needs this ability , too . 	0
But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating , that is , the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker , but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave . 	0
Excellent knowledge is better than ability to adopt oneself 	0
With the rapid development of economy , the controversial of good worker ' s requirement is always in a limelight . 	0
A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary , because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker . 	0
From my perspective , there is only one thing would be beneficial to company , and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker , that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job . 	1
However , if you aren ' t extremely dedicated or have good time management skills , it may be very difficult to complete a course at home . 	0
You can study any time you want . 	0
In addition , you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course . 	0
The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day . 	0
Studying at home by using technology is convenient . 	1
Here are my reasons . 	0
I don ' t think that technology can replace teachers and classroom . 	1
Study at home by using technology / study or traditional school 	0
Especially when you don ' t have an instructor there to guide you , it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements . 	0
First , attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience . 	0
Which do you prefer : do only what you already do well , or not . 	0
As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time ; also , it is regarded as the " legalized revenge " to victims ' family . 	0
In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology . 	1
However , some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment . 	0
In my view , the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act . 	0
Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably . 	0
Secondly , cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive , so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs . 	0
Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport , for instance . 	0
In conclusion , it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence . 	1
On the other hand , there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities . 	1
Firstly , the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries . 	0
Obviously , police officers can force a criminal to surrender , because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public . 	0
As a result , some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence . 	1
On the one hand , I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun . 	0
An obvious example of this happens in The United State , a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon , while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him . 	0
Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act . 	0
Personally , I tend to disagree with this statement , while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence . 	0
Do guns can really increase the level of violence ? 	0
The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world . 	0
In summary , students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education . 	1
Therefore , schools should be responsible for their future and protect them . 	1
For instance , you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry . 	0
In addition , although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects , in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects . 	0
Science today , for example , is said to be more and more specialized , but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics . 	0
General education plays a significant role in specialized education . 	0
This might result in limited choices in the future . 	0
They might avoid tough courses , but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much . 	0
Last but not least , students have tendency to shun difficulties . 	0
Therefore , high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university . 	1
Next , students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields . 	0
For instance , a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field . 	0
I think , however , students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics . 	1
They believe this motivates students to study . 	0
Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to . 	0
High schools must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum 	0
They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects , otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject . 	0
To begin with , students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested . 	1
In addition , it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles . 	1
I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university . 	1
Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group . 	0
In fact , I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality . 	1
To conclude , there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group . 	0
Personally , when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time , it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful . 	0
Also , it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future . 	0
For example , answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent . 	0
Additionally , we are building our personalities when we study alone . 	1
In this way , the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place , so the country will develop at a rapid pace . 	0
Furthermore , being a citizen in society should protect the country ' s culture and history . 	0
The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community . 	0
Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention , but this argument is invalid . 	0
That ' s not enough , for higher education , which represent the cutting edge of a country ' s academic achievements , act as the vanguard in economic and social advance . 	0
Government budget focus , young children or university ? 	0
" Education is the investment in our future " , as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out , education , which fosters a civilized society , plays a significant role in a country ' s long-lasting prosperity . 	0
As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both . 	1
So that , government should invest to create more jobs . 	1
Consequently , quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy . 	0
Therefore , in my opinion , I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first . 	1
Thus , these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity . 	0
Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting , there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation . 	0
Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people 	0
There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities . 	0
When people did not have money , They had to rob other people . 	0
Then , many people did not have money . 	0
First , as you can see that after great economic recession , many people in many countries were unemployed . 	0
Ergo , opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime . 	0
However , one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences . 	0
In short , these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers . 	1
In the event of an argument , the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken . 	0
Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras . 	1
Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . 	0
Furthermore , at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers . 	0
Thus , it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized . 	1
Hence , the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded . 	0
At times , face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger . 	0
They do not undergo any pain or misery . 	0
Why do not we have other wisely punishments ? 	0
As we can see some industries such as mining , oil and gas extraction , reclamation , etc , needs many labors . 	0
Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country - it is better . 	0
Moreover , rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts . 	0
To conclude , capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge , it is an easy way for serious crimes , and nobody has rights to take others life ; thus , it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society . 	1
The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty . 	1
For instance , my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life , he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice . 	0
To conclude , I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers . 	1
I think when we leave school , maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life , but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day . 	1
For example , I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me . 	0
Thirdly , I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally . 	0
