Hence it can be maintained that the nationalization of a concern , or even of a whole industrial branch , is not a socialistic measure since the rest of the economy continues to be based on the principle of private initiative and of the market economy since the nationalized branch is itself subject to the discipline of the market , particularly by paying its way by means of sales rather than by means of subsidies from the state . 	1

The long-distance delivery of weapons of mass destruction altered the character of war itself . 	0
The fact that the war was finally won in the East by tactics that had nothing to do with this ( the atomic bomb ) doesn ' t alter the circumstances in which the war began . 	0
It might , though , make us think about why things since 1945 have been so different . 	0
On the first aspect : the conflict that we undertook ( rightly , I believe ) in 1939 belonged to a world in which wars were still fought between clearly defined sovereign states struggling over the control of territory . 	0
Both sides could ( and did ) inflict the tactics of terror on the other by aerial bombardment ; but whether in France or Russia or the Western Desert , the heart of the conflict was about promoting or resisting territorial advance . 	0

Jurors , especially less educated and articulate ones , may be wary of speaking out if they know they are being judged by an audience at home . 	0

According to reliable sources who spoke to Human Rights Watch , doctors from several humanitarian organizations who were in the theater ' s immediate vicinity sought access to the released hostages but were denied by security officials . 	0

Obviously , it couldn ' t have come from Christian influences for the simple reason that there wasn ' t any Christianity yet ! 	0
If you deny that Jesus really did rise from the dead , then you ' ve got to explain the origin of the disciples ' belief either in terms of Jewish influences or Christian influences . 	0
As the reknowned New Testament scholar Joachim Jeremias puts it , " Nowhere does one find in the literature [ of ancient Judaism ] anything comparable to the resurrection of Jesus . " { 20 } The most plausible explanation of the origin of the disciples ' belief , therefore , is that Jesus really did rise from the dead . 	1

We can know that Jesus rose from the dead , wholly apart from a consideration of historical evidence . 	0
We can know Jesus rose because Jesus is alive today and by God ' s spirit He is an living reality to those who follow him . 	0
The simplest Christian who has neither the oppurtunity nor wherewithal to conduct an historical investigation of Jesus ' resurrection can know with assurance that Jesus has risen simply because God ' s spirit bears unmistakable witness to Him that this is so . 	0
This means that no one is justified in rejecting the Christian faith simply because the evidence isn ' t good enough . 	0
If were no historical resurrection , then there then today there would be no encounter with the risen Lord and no witness of the Spirit . 	0
From the fact that there is such an encounter and witness , it follows logically that there was historical resurrection , even if in certain situations historical evidence concerning the resurrection , which is available at that time and place , is slim , ambiguous , or even deleterious .

So if God creates a world that operates according to certain natural laws , then the fire that warms us will also be the fire that burns us , and it may well be the case that an all-good God would want to create a world governed by natural law , which includes the possibility of harm . 	1

Prior to the invasion , he said , the major opposition groups in exile had prepared for a rapid transfer of sovereignty to a provisional Iraqi government , but these plans were quickly sidetracked by coalition leaders . 	0

Take premise ( 2 ) , that an all powerful God can create any world that He wants . 	0
Now the problem with this argument is that Dr . Curley hasn ' t shown either of the two crucial premises to be necessarily true . 	0
So Dr . Curley would have to show that there is a world of free creatures , which God could create , which has as much good as this world , but which has less evil . 	0

So let ' s look at my first major contention together , that there are no good reasons to think that atheism is true . 	1
Atheism , or the claim that there is no God , is just as much a claim to know something as is theism , the claim that God does exist . 	0
Therefore , if the atheist is to prove his view , he must do more than say , " There ' s no good evidence for God ' s existence . " 	0
He must present positive evidence against God ' s existence . 	0
Atheist philosophers have tried for centuries to disprove the existence of God , but no one has been able to come up with a convincing argument . 	0

How much more probable ? 	0
We now know that life-prohibiting universes are vastly more probable than life - permitting universes like ours . 	0
God provides the best explanation for the complex order in the universe . { 8 } During the last thirty years , scientists have discovered that the existence of intelligent life depends upon a complex and delicately balanced set of initial conditions simply given in the Big Bang itself . 	1
Donald Page , one of America ' s eminent cosmologists , has calculated the odds of our universe existing as on the order of one chance out of 1010 ( 123 ) , a number which is so inconceivable that to call it astronomical would be a wild understatement ! { 9 } Robert Jastrow , the head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , has called this the most powerful evidence for the existence of God " ever to come out of science . " { 10 } Once again , the view that Christian theists have always held , that there is an intelligent designer of the Cosmos , seems to me to be much more plausible than the atheistic interpretation of chance . 	0
Now with those numbers in mind , consider the following . 	0
The number of subatomic particles in the entire universe is about1080 . 	0
The number of seconds in the history of the universe is about 1018 , that ' s ten followed by eighteen zeros . 	0

A strong Chinese partnership with a recovering Russia is the preferred countermeasure . 	0
This chapter , which introduces the views of 55 Chinese authors on Russia , lists the factors they foresee Russia will face in its future dangerous security environment . 	0
Chinese military estimates of Russian national power by 2010 to 2020 place Russia as the second - or at least the third-ranking country in terms of overall military power . 	0

In spite of these dangers , they believe Russia also has advantages , such as its potential partnership with China and advanced military concepts and technology , which cause China to assess the Russians as far more likely to exploit successfully the revolution in military affairs ( RMA ) than the United States . 	0

We should therefore think of them as . . . the concepts of an unlimited mind : a divine mind . { 3 } At the most abstract level , then , theism provides a plausible , metaphysical foundation for the existence of abstract objects . 	0
