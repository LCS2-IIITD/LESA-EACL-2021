It seems to me if we are reporting what Smith said , Smith ' s own writings are probably the best possible source . 	0
" . . . considering Smiths own writings it is not more accurate " Why do you say that ? 	0
He doesn ' t mention considering non-Christian faiths , so it seems natural to state that he was trying to decide which Christian church to join . " 	0
Smith said he was trying to decide between the different " sects " , and he mentions the Methodists , the Presbyterians , and so forth . 	0

Nu metal is just an umbrella term used to describe all metal bands that add elements of alternative or rap music to their music . 	0

I view Smith ' s 1838 personal history as a good source for explaining what he said happened to him . ) 	0

What I have opposed is the addition of details about how newspapers in the early 1830s were mocking Smith for having claimed to have seen God . 	0
That ' s unneeded detail , and I thought it was what we were talking about all along . 	0
Where did I say the detail of who Smith saw are too specific ? 	0
I ' ve never disputed that . 	1
So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0
I don ' t understand why you believe it ' s not relevant . 	0

In particular Promethea is a tremendous work by a man who has won several writing awards , who has had many works turned into blockbuster movies , and is certainly one of the most significant writers in the world today . 	0

Again , notice that argueing for biodiversity we use evolutionary forces . 	0
Arguing for common ancestor we use common characteristics of all organisms . 	0
August 2006 ( UTC ) The source of diversity is explained by evolution : natural selection and genetic drift in the broadest possible sense . 	0
The thoery of common ancestor does not rely on the concept of natural selection or genetic drift . 	0
Rather it relies on the fact that all organisms have commonalities to them which are best explained by a common ancestor ( such as nucleotides , cell membrane , chirality of amino acids , genetic code ) ; notice that none of these can be used to create a phyloenetic tree of biodiversity as they are present in ' all organisms in the exact same state ( there are exeptions of course , but they are minor ) . 	0

In this article , however , we state simply : He also been accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . which brings the reliably cited accusations and refutations simply ; not imposing one reliable sources view over the other , and leave further discussion to the child article per summary style . 	0

There is no need to include a specific band just because one source ( MTV , a commercial source , whose purpose is to increase album sales ) includes this band , when dozens of sources discredit the application of this term , and when the article for the term uses musical phrases that have nothing to do with the style of music that this band actually performs . 	1

The very essence of what is involved in the proper understanding of pseudoscience and skepticism are being violated here . 	0
When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0
If they have any legitimate criticisms , then it should be possible to find them in mainstream sources , not fringe sources . 	0

By quoting other sources instead of just writing without quotes , this alerts to the reader that the quote is different than the other statements in that it may come from a bias source ( which is not saying a source is necessarily bias ) , and so dissipates any hidden bias which keeps with the neutrality of the article . 	0

Ronabop ' s comment was snarky , but I didn ' t find it particularly uncivil , probably because I interpreted it as a generally sarcastic remark rather than a direct personal attack . 	1
Specifically , I was reprimanding Somnobot ' s " quit whining " comment , which was patently uncivil , and Talv ' s " I can tell you have an agenda you ' re attempting to push " comment , which I found mildly , but inappropriately , accusatory in nature ( see WP : AGF ) . 	0

In any case , what a handful of rock journalists have said is beside the point , considering that progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music , and they have none of the musical elements associated with the term " nu metal " . 	1

But others simply use " non-Indo-European " , which avoids giving the impression that Basque hasn ' t changed since primeval times ; so I ' d prefer to use " non-Indo-European " rather than " pre-Indo-European " . 	0

If it isn ' t , then the source is only presenting its opinion ( or in this case , characterization ) . 	0
And if we are going to allow characterizations made by sources which don ' t represent the scientific community in general but kind of slant towards that way , then we also have to include characterizations made by sources which slant the other way . 	0
I think some editors only want to include sources which are generally regarded as trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience . 	0
If that were the case , this article would only include items which are definitively pseudoscientific per the scientific community in general ; for if a source is truly trustworthy / authoritative with regards to pseudoscience , then it speaks for scientific community in general . 	1
The sources which we choose should be trustworthy / authoritative in presenting the sources characterization . 	0
I think there might be confusion here . 	0
@Eldereft . 	0
Per your point - " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " - remember that the subject at hand is not pseudoscience but rather the characterization of such . 	0
Essentially , this could be a black-and-white article where we only present items which are definitively pseuodscience per the scientific community in general . 	0
But once we allow " characterizations " in this article , it ceases to be black-and-white , but rather a range of gray . 	0

The question , as stated above , is not whether it ' s relevant to the IDF , but whether it is undue weight and recentism . 	0
The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0
If you think this implies that my postion is that " . . . . 	0
Jeez ! 	0
In either case , this isn ' t moving forward . 	0
Well to me , as an old fart , this multiplicity of sub-sub-sub-genres is both divisive and unnecessary , since these terms seem to be created either by rock journalists , whom Frank Zappa once described as " people , who can ' t write , interviewing people , who can ' t talk , for people , who can ' t read . " , or by the fans themselves in order to distinguish themselves from some other sub-sect . 	1

Anyway , there ' s an alternate image of a pro-life gathering . 	0
That said , my own personal concern for the pictures is the unintended Amerocentrism ; it would be nice to to have capture an image of activists in the abortion debate in another country . 	0
Also , the current pair of pictures create a thematic juxtaposition , centred about two Washington landmarks . 	0
For reference , my input is that she be listed R&B , reggae , pop , rock . 	0
After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0
I ' m having a very hard time seeing why the first would be preferable . 	1

The most ghits seem to be found supporting that Rihanna is R&B , then pop , and I only found that allmusic source supporting reggae . 	0

Very few references can be found to support that Rihanna is a reggae singer , all I managed to find was her allmusic page which lists reggae after pop , and lists both as styles under the main genre R&B . 	1
This is a new discussion , to gain new consensus . 	0

The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0

I think it is important for the article to state this percentage to put the scandal in perspective . 	0
The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

And if we ' re talking about the Spanish Inquisition , and giving figures , then it is important to note that most of the Inquisition killings occurred in a twenty year period when the Inquisition was run by Torquemada and it was involved in the campaign against supposed false Moorish conversos under Ferdinand and Isabella . 	0
Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0

It does not seem logical to deem Hamas " terrorist " and not israel at the same time . 	1
I believe Hamas actions have NEVER been more " terroristic " than ANY other group involved in the war . . . . . israeli or Palestinian groups … … and therefore , I am simply advocating for FAIR AND BALANCED behavior and descriptions of ALL parties involved . 	0
If you wish to see proof of the extent of all parties " terrorism " actions / consequences , check the statistics section on this website . . . http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp … . 	0
Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0
To claim that Hamas is the cause of MORE " terrorism " activities / targeting is simply against the facts and numbers . 	0

As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1

The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
The article that focusses on his presidency will have a much more narrow focus and will include much of what I am assuming you wish to see in his bio . 	0

Trying to paraphrase your argument , you say that reliable sources should be used , but that some editors only want to use reliable sources that are authoritative voices regarding pseudoscientific concepts . 	0
I don ' t think you are making a clear point Levine2112 . 	0
However then you go one to say that these sources are themselves pseudoscientific because they are authorities on pseudoscience . 	0

Authorities in science which make comments on pseudoscience are not pseudoscientific themselves . 	0
That is a very careless argument . 	1

In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1

Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0

So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0

I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0

I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0

It probably deserves its own article ( very interesting case of apparent archaeological forgery ) ; in this article it deserves nothing but a very short sentence along the lines of : In 2006 , a set of early Basque inscriptions were reported at Veleia , seeming to push the earliest dated writing in Basque to the third Century , but the were soon discovered to be forgeries . 	1

On average , the temperature of the earth is not increasing , and that ' s a sure sign that the energy it takes in from the sun is eventually emitted into space ( as radiation at longer wave-lengths ) . 	1

The temperature of a planet is roughly determined by equating its blackbody radiation output with how much it absorbs by the sun . 	0
If it absorbed more than it emitted , its temperature would increase … 	0

Trawling up odd snippets about the Bishop of Yakima hiring a man " under investigation " for viewing pornography as a student ( and who was then dismissed from the seminary ) does not make it a world-shattering event - or show that the Catholic Church is uniquely evil - as seems to be an underlying theme here . 	0

On a side note , I see there is a small incomplete chart of Israel military casualties here , I would like to see a full article devoted to Israel ' s casualties like this one : United States casualties of war . 	0
Countries with much more " colorful " military history such as the United States armed forces , French Armed Forces , British Armed Forces , and Indian Armed Forces have no similar controversy section . 	0
For starters , it looks very misplaced . 	0
However I must take issue with the controversy controversy section . 	0
I ' ve been reviewing the article and for the most part it ' s pretty solid . 	0
To be perfectly honest I think those 3 articles could be easily moved into a single article , and any left pertinent information could be moved here . 	0
I propose we move the controversy section to Military history of Israel , History of the Israel Defense Forces , or Israeli wars and armed conflict . 	0
Why is the IDF article any different ? 	0
There is certainly more than enough reliable sources to support one , so the absence is telling . 	0

I don ' t feel that reggae should be listed before pop as the latter is more prevalent in the artist ' s music . 	1
Starting this discussion because a user was not happy with the genres being listed as " R&B , pop , reggae " instead of " R&B , reggae , pop " and an edit war over such an arrangement would be silly . 	0
R&B and pop have been the artist ' s main genres since her second album and influences were also present on her first . 	0
Reggae was prevalent on the artist ' s first album and partially on her second ; from 2008 to present , only influences have been present . 	0
How do other editors feel about this proposal ? 	0
The artist is more known for her contributions to those two genres than to reggae , which is why they should be listed first . 	0

Yes , because they are very-well known and have sold many albums ; but more importantly because the bulk of their music itself is in majority straight in line with heavy metal music tradition . 	0
Similarly , compare Black Sabbath and Jethro Tull . . . who is a full-time heavy metal band and who simply dabbles with it occasionaly ? 	0
That ' s not the issue here . 	0
I can place a bet that any book about heavy metal history that ' s worth its money mentions Judas Priest somewhere in there . 	1
Many early Rock n Rollers were influenced by delta blues artist Robert Johnson ; that doesn ' t make Johnson ' s music become Rock n Roll . 	0
Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

We ought to use the correct rather than colloquial name . 	0
Okay , we can clean up a few things . 	0
One way or another we need to keep this section manageable , and the most obvious solution is to chop off stuff of tangential relevance . 	0
The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event , but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened , when , whose fault it was , and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama , not BP and its tribulations . 	0
No , if you look towards the bottom of the page ( in the succession navigation box ) , where predecessors and successors for any awards , offices , etc one has held or received , you will clearly see that Carol Moseley Braun is his " predecessor " and Alexi Gianoulias as his " successor " . 	1

To truly be labelled a pseudoscience , as per WP : PSCI , the topic must be an Obvious pseudoscience or Generally considered pseudoscience . 	0

I am going to tag this entire article with POV issues tag . 	0
Currently , this article violates this fundemental principle of Wikipedia because it is purposefully excluding certain significant views on what characterizes a pseudoscience . 	1

So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0
Martin gets off very lightly . 	0

In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

How is it that I ' m saying Hamas " . . . isn ' t targeting cvilians " ? ? ? ? 	0
I only add that the U . S . , israel and almost every other country that has waged war in history , targets civlians AS WELL ( as per the definitions of the Geneva Conventions ) , so it is only fair to use the term " employing terrorist tactics " on the " Hamas " wiki page ONLY if the same standards are used on the wiki pages of other governing bodies who have been shown to " employ " the same " tactics " . 	0
As my statement ( and supporting references of the Geneva Convention articles and news sources ) clearly show that I DO believe Hamas targets civlians . … … 	1
Hamas isn ' t targeting civilians . . . . " , then maybe a course in English would be a logical step for you BEFORE engaging in disscuasions in that particular language . 	0

The abuse scandal is not properly addressed for NPOV . 	0
This is a problem that one faction of editors does not understand . 	0
Both Britannica and the Encarta articles on the Church do a better job of addressing the abuse scandal in the life of the Church . 	0
The article as it is written states that the abuse is a recent U . S . anomaly while plenty of serious books written from both within the Church and without give another view . 	0
That other view must be in this article for it to be NPOV . 	0

I would not put Cartman ' s mom in the same class of characters as SKCK , even though she has often had as much screen-time as any one of thm and is sometimes central to the plot . 	0
The show has a large supporting cast of characters some of whom become more or less prominent depending on the episode - and we can through in the eight parents , and Ike , while we are at it . 	0
South prk revolves around the relationshps among Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny , sometimes through their separate adventures . 	0
The effec is identical - so who do you think you are fooling ( except possibly yourself ) when you protest that " main " does not appear ? 	0
When you removed " main " from Butters , you removed it for the other four . 	0
When these characters were identified as main , you added " main " to Butters . 	0
The issue is not whether or not Butters is identifid as a " main " character , the question is whether Butters is given the sam prominence as Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny . 	0

It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
I found " Zionist Regime " and other descriptions instead . 	0
I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

As an aside , I seriously hope that we do not include scientology as sources regarding psychiatry , there is simply no need and it detracts from the case made by ' actual scientists and medical professionals ' . 	0
Aliens in DC-10s notwithstanding , scientology have made themselves notable when they have the likes of Tom Cruise decrying psychiatry on prime-time tv . 	0
This would defuse the oncoming impasse and allow readers to judge for themselves if they consider the sources authoritative . 	0

That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1
I ' m unclear on what you mean . 	0
I suppose I am confused , then - could you specify what these different lines of evidence are , one supporting common descent and the other supporting biodiversity ? 	0

It is true that I unilaterally picked what should be mentioned , taking into account scale , significance , and pratical prose / style concerns . 	0

You seem to be asserting that if the scientific community comes to a consensus that something is a pseudoscience that is not enough for inclusion here as a pseudoscience . 	0

I for one do not think that the controversy / criticism section needs to be any bigger than any one of the history , structure or equipment sections . 	1
There are also multiple organizations , notably Breaking the Silence , that deal specifically with this issue ( see above discussion with Deborahjay ) , and there is a main article for the recent controversy . 	0
If we included even a small paragraph for every controversy of a similar scope to the recent soldiers ' testimonies , we ' d easily get a 100K section only for criticism , because there were a series of such testimonies after each major operation , and some of the notable cases are listed here . 	1

The statement is potentially inaccurate and certainly unwise to feature in the lead . 	0
Putting this in the lead will just cause more vandalism to the article than there is now ( which is already substantial ) . 	0
The lead is supposed to be a summary of the body of the article , not an independent editorial . 	0

So I guess the issue is , roughly : Is the phrase " characterized as " equivalent to " which are characterized as " ( a present-tense passive-voice adjectival clause ) ? 	0
But as I also said , I believe editors should attempt to be collectively clearer , i . e . to arrive at some kind of consensus about what the scope of the list is in this regard . 	0

In fact , there are no references to HIV isolation at all , and I felt it important to include this information . 	0
I cited the CDC report , as well as the Gallo and Montegnier publications . 	0
I can not think of a better source than the ORIGINAL papers being cited , as I did . 	0
Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1
There are people who test HIV + who have NEVER developed AIDS and these case start in the 80 ' s . 	0

Anyway , comparing Operation Cast Lead to the Second Lebanon War is clueless at best . 	1
It follows a recent trend in worldwide media to assess the scale of a conflict by civilian casualties , which , indeed , is completely irrelevant . 	0
The Second Lebanon War was far larger in scale , both military and political . 	0
But forget that ; the real problem with adding this " war " is that it ' s not even a war . 	1
Aside from the media , there is no evidence that the historical record refers to it as a war ; it is simply recentism . 	0
Comparetively , Operation Defensive Shield was also referred to as a war by many media sources , and probably Operation Litani ( although I wasn ' t alive then and so couldn ' t follow the media ) . 	0
In addition , Israel very clear defines what is a war and what isn ' t , so at least the first instance of the addition , which clearly refers to " Israel ' s wars " , shouldn ' t be there . 	0
In light of the above , I have two very important questions for you , which I request that you ( and anyone else wishing to add information about Cast Lead to this article ) address : — 	0

You don ' t seem to view the Mormonism movement as anything of value in either Christian Theology or American History . 	0

We can forget about Cole ' s earlier 1830 " Book of Pukei " article which has nothing to do with this subject . 	0

At the same time , our enthusiasm for this report must be tempered by a realistic view of both the history of sensational announcements in HIV research and our goals at Wikipedia . 	1
From time to time , we see a report on the nightly news that HIV infection or AIDS has been " cured " . 	1

" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0

And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0

RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0

While no one , except mostly reality show stars , become famous / notable for their personal lives , I do not believe that it ' s trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia . 	1
But , really , I do not see the Personal life sections as that different than the Early life sections , except for the fact that the Early life sections deal with a person ' s early personal life . . . while the other deals with the person ' s later personal life . 	0
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about " the incident " pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section . 	0

Beside one small change , which I discussed ( admittedly , after some reverts ) , I only touched the article now to defend it from POV-pushers , trying to radically change the lead to fit their views , like User : Kupredu . 	0

It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0
To compound this you keep trying to link it to Zionist entity . 	0

To use entity is very POV . 	1
You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0
Secondly , entity is not even close to the most widespread translation and the first time I have ever heard the word entity used for Israel was this article . 	0

These persons are called to fulfill God ' s will in their lives and , if they are Christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord ' s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . 	0
Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0
If the athiests who keep coming to rewrite the article with POV don ' t actually read things like the Catechism then we can never hope for a real NPOV . 	0
As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0
If the media and the public fails to grasp that , the public record of those official hearings is not irrelevant or subordinate ( or even equal ) to that . 	0

What accounts for that counter-intuitive 20% drop in the HIV - > AIDS progression rate from the subjects infected 10 and 15 years prior ? 	0
This is slightly confusing ( at least to me ) because the abstract also mentions that only 68% of HIV-positive subjects infected 14 years prior progressed to AIDS . 	0

The current sentence says " The Sun provides a large amount of energy to the Earth , and this flow of heat results in huge increases in entropy " - which is true but it ignores the fact that the earth is emitting all of this energy back into space . 	0
The point of all of this is that since the net effect is an increase in entropy outside of the earth , the earth can " afford " to lose entropy without violating the second law . 	0
Therefore the " entropy argument " by the creationists is faulty . 	1

I ' m not up to it tonight , but perhaps by reiterating that " first lady " has the split meanings of presidential spouse / social hostess , it could be stated more clearly . 	0

Karanacs , surely the idea of peer review is to get input from people who haven ' t previously been involved in editing an article ? 	0

Presumably a female President would still be the hostess , but it seems ridiculous to suggest the President could also be the First Lady at the same time ( unless the US has a lesbian President , and let ' s not go there . . . ) 	0

Bush never dropped out of a specific church though , so the comparison really isn ' t applicable . 	1

But I don ' t see why a First Gentleman couldn ' t perform all the functions of a ' hostess ' , if he was minded to do so . 	0
But here is the second , and very key , point to address - who would be the " hostess of the white house " ? 	0
By definition , the husband cannot be the hostess , so who would be ? 	0
It is all speculation , and it will probably be decided by the mainstream press as much as by the officeholder himself . 	0
" First Gentleman " seems to be the most likely candidate . 	0
Remember ; first lady has two meanings , " spouse of the president " and " hostess of the whitehouse " . 	0
So , in the case of a female president , what would we call her spouse ? 	0

A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0
Where and when ? 	0
" Corporal punishment " applied to everyone who wasn ' t a noble up until fairly recent times . 	0
Francis Xavier didn ' t only " evangelise " Thomas christians , but non-christians as well . 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

I don ' t think it ' s fair to have one image of a few pro-life activists and another image of a huge crowd of pro-choice activists . 	0

Since dancehall is a subgenre of reggae , I ' d suggest listing Her as Contemporary R&B ( which includes hip hop / rap ) , Reggae , Pop music ( which includes dance-pop ) , and Rock music . 	1

Popper also stated " When speaking here of Darwinism , I shall speak always of today ' s theory - that is Darwin ' s own theory of natural selection supported by the Mendelian theory of heredity . . " so the statement about Darwin ' s original theory is nonsense . 	0
I can ' t speak about the other named persons , but Julian Whitaker is an infamous pusher of several forms of quackery and pseudoscience , and his skepticism is of precisely the type referred to by Robert Todd Carroll here : Those who are skeptical of the mainstream scientific position are indeed " skeptical " in the generic sense , but they aren ' t " scientific skeptics " . 	0

We need to be careful about how the word " skeptical " is being used here ( by you ) . 	0
When dealing with this list and all articles that mention disputes between mainstream and fringe / alternative sources , " skeptical " is referring specifically to " scientific skepticism " , as our wikilink clearly indicates . 	1

The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1

What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1

Now , as for sources . 	0
Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0

I ' ve never seen what makes ' hard rock ' debated , except in the context of whether a song or band is ' metal ' or ' hard rock ' during metal discussions . 	0
I agree that the Catholic Church did a lot more good than bad ( and still does ) . 	0
I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0

The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
Interesting interpretations of the Anglo-Irish treaty aside , the Free State never had control over Northern Ireland . 	0
Southern Irish troops ( we didn ' t have tanks ) didn ' t march in one day and out the next . 	0
At the time there was no disagreement that Great Britain ( with or without Northern Ireland ) was to be the successor state of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland . 	0
Thus it is was the Free State that joined the League of Nations as an entirely new entity while the UK remained a member . 	0
As a matter of English there ' s no ambiguity in saying that Northern Ireland remained in the UK . 	0
Legally speaking it ' s the rules of state succession that determine whether the 1923 UK was the same state as the 1920 UK . 	0

The Statement : " Belfast is a city in the United Kingdom " was as true in 1920 as it was in 1923 and as it is now . 	0

The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1

Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U .

The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

( edit conflict ) As noted in my edit summary , this article is about the life and career of Barack Obama . 	0
It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0
The second set of statements , if they belong anywhere , would make most sense in an article on LBGT politics or sociology . 	0

No one will argue with the fact that SF is known for its large LBGT population . 	0

My main objection to change would be the amount of work necessary to re-order the article and re-write . 	0
The section is probably too long , as I have already said . 	0
One way of changing it would be to have a sentence ot two on origin and basic mission at the start of the article , with more detailed material placed under " History " and " beliefs " . 	0
Is the section really a problem as is ? 	0
Again , that is just a possible option for discussion . 	0
or we could trim the Origins and Mission section by more than half , turning it into an introductory paragraph to the main article , again with any important detail transferred to " history . " 	0

[ 38 ] } } Ironically , Obama is asking Americans to place their trust in the abortion doctors making hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in potentially harming other human beings , when it is not in their best interests to even reveal that children are surviving their abortions , let alone care for those children , as it could endanger their industry and cause unnecessary expense . 	0
The bill ' s purpose was reasonable , to ensure at least 2 physicians were accountable for verifying live-born children were not in fact surviving the abortions , to prevent the same " infanticide " that led Congress to declare partial birth abortion illegal . 	0
This double-physician standard leads to further physician accountability and better assurance that children who survive abortions are not left to die unattended . 	0

The newly rewritten intro - This is a list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by organizations within the international scientific community , by notable skepticalorganizations , or by notable academics or researchers . . . - makes no mention of the organizations or people being only those with " mainstream " points of view . 	0
I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

There I found the allegations of phosphorus weapon use , so I proceeded to add a few tightly written sentences including citations plus internal and external links . 	0
So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0

No doubt you will bring attention to the statement : " . . . would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated " . . . in order to argue that U .

Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

You have pointed to at most seven sources on the band ' s talk page ( out of , what , hundreds of sources available ? ) , all of which are only web sources ( no print has been considered ) , and most of which are useless because they are album reviews , or they are simply unreliable . 	0
There is no sound argument to back the assertion that " progressive rock , art rock , experimental rock and alternative metal are used more often in relation to the band ' s music " . 	0
Also , the artists themselves are not considered objective sources for determing genre . 	0

What it does tell us , in conjunction with the other article from prominent pre-1900 members of the church is that there was a discussion about Smith ' s claims to have seen a Vision and that vision involved God . 	0

All Gore tried that one , and well maybe we should believe him , after all he did invent the internet and has does have a Bachelor ' s degree in Government . 	0
Seriously though , that is a broad and unsubstantiated claim and you have provided no evidence to support it . 	0
If it did happen , how would including it detract from its relevance ? 	0
Smith did not claim to " frequently seeing God " just as you say , however what is interesting about this article is when it is taken in context with Smith ' s own writings of how the community received his ideas does support his claims , if somewhat indirectly . 	0

When you look through most other photos , you see the caption is a description given to what the user sees in the photo . 	0
As I understand it , a caption given by an uploader or by a flikr stream owner is unverifiable and as such not according to WP standards . 	0
Often it adds information that is only evident to a professional ( explaining that the rhino in the picture is an african rhino ) but a caption should not add information not evident in the photo ( explaining that the rhino ' s name is Susan ) , unless this information can be sourced . 	0
Unfortunately , it ' s a Pay-Per-View , and I can only get the title and first line , though these are clear enough to illustrate my point . 	0

The part about Protestant propaganda per my source was that the two brutal non-church initiated or controlled inquisitions of Philip IV of France and Spanish Inquisition was used by Protestants to demonize the Catholic Church for centuries . 	0
I do not agree that the paragraph should have been changed to eliminate this fact . 	0
The Spanish Inquisition was the worst of them all and executed many people 3-4000 per my source . 	0
I disagree with the change also , I left a note on Xandars page . 	1

As the user also noted in their recent edits , the medical consensus on the issue is that HIV does cause AIDS . 	0
The lead was recently changed by User : Neuromancer to indicate that the causative role of HIV in AIDS isn ' t proven ( see diff ) . 	1
Thus I think adding a caveat about the unproven nature of HIV ' s causative role in AIDS isn ' t just an example of undue weight , but is furthermore incorrect . 	1
To my understanding , if medical consensus supports some hypothesis based on verifying experiments and overwhelming amounts of empirical evidence , then that notion is considered a scientific fact . 	0
Based on that rationale , I ' ve reverted Neuromancer ' s edits for the second time . 	1
Neuromancer also added to the lead a paragraph citing research from 1982 and 1983 , which I consider more appropriate for other sections of the article if it ' s to be included at all . 	0
I ' d like to get Neuromancer ' s thoughts on this , as well as feedback from other editors - - with whom I presume but would like to verify I share a consensus - - so that my recent reversion doesn ' t seem like a single-editor fiat . 	1

I appreciate you pointing out that you agree with that , and hope that you understand it was NOT my intention to imply that because of their status today , Hamas ' previous ( or present ) actions are to be define in a different way . 	0

This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0
Now , I realize we are talking about a global situation , and not just one that relates to the U . S . . 	0
Would it not seem logical , then , to specifically state that the designation / label / view of Hamas is a matter of debate / discussion / confussion within international community standards ? 	1

It seems like we are spending too much time discussing what is and isn ' t proper in terms of tagging , rather than discussing the heart of this issue . 	0
Our current inclusion criteria would definitely allow sourced mention , especially since it is not us who are characterizing , but the sources . 	1
The situation is that it qualifies as Questionable science , and because " some critics allege to be pseudoscience , may contain information to that effect , but generally should not be so characterized . " 	0
It ' s all a matter of how the mainstream changes its views on things , and on how the V & RS document that change . 	0
Who knows , at some point in time psychoanalysis may become a historical artifact that will easily fall into the " Generally considered pseudoscience " or " Obvious pseudoscience " class , and we ' ll then be justified in adding PS category tags to the articles ! 	0

Lastly , you are vandalizing the article because you are inserting content against consensus ( or at least , without one ) , not to mention the little effort that was apparently put in to proper spelling and capitalization in the edits . 	1
We will need some mainstream sources that use , or discuss the use , of the IOF as an alternative name to IDF , not sources that accuse IDF of occupation , which is a completely different issue . 	0
In general , when trying to insert an alternative term for any article name , this needs to have some official or mainstream credibility , and the guidelines are more stringent than for representing two opposing viewpoints in the article ' s content . 	0
They refer to Israeli forces as occupiers , but do not use the term Israeli Occupation Forces ( notice the capitalization ) as an alternative to Israel Defense Forces ( you are trying to insert a passage into the article which says that the IDF is also called IOF by some , which is not supported by Sean Hoyland ' s articles , and is well-known to represent a fringe point of view — see WP : FRINGE ) . 	0

In any case , I will chime in when I read anything that makes me reconsider ( or reaffirm ) my position . 	0
It still appears to me that driving the organization of the article so as to make these connections explicit risks giving the article assertive connotations , something that I think we all agree should be avoided , whether or not we agree it will actually happen as I suggest . 	0
Given the existence of both the history and theology subarticles , there seems ample opportunity to flesh out these connections in places the context makes it clear we are being descriptive . 	0

I wasn ' t suggesting putting it in the lead . 	0
It ' s true that it isn ' t a legal or national title ( although who knows , maybe its usage is mandated by certain sources in their official communications , I don ' t know ) but its presence in RS does indicate that it is some kind of alternate name ( and its validity doesn ' t come into it ) . 	0
' a vocal minority aren ' t capable of intellectual thought process ' , given that there is consensus within the international community about a set of things called the Israeli occupied territories it ' s hardly surprising that the IOF term would exist and be used in RS and as part of the defense vs occupation narrative war ( which is , in my view , very similar to the settlement vs neighborhood narrative war ) . 	0

The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

Halford and Dunn ' s opinions were used as a reference to depict a certain viewpoint in the Traditional Heavy Metal article . 	0
Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes . [ 161 ] " Also , I ' m changing the wording back about South Africa ' s AIDS denialism ; phrasing it as HIV-AIDS link makes it sound like the link is shakey or something . 	0
While consensus can block sources due to a lack of quality , it cannot block simply because they claim consensus . 	0
Furthermore , according to that same article , " Likewise , exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources , and , with clear editorial consensus , unreliable sources for exceptional claims may be rejected due to a lack of quality . " 	0

Logically , Wikipedia consensus should not be all that ' s needed to make a fringe theory notable , just as it should not be all that ' s needed to reject notable and well-sourced criticisms . 	0

I think this is detail that could be relevant and be included in a more specific article , such as First Vision . 	1

" This article should be about what is actually pseudoscience , not what some lone crank considers pseudoscience " - That ' s what I ' ve been trying to say . 	0
Sorry if I didn ' t make myself clear . 	0
Just because a source is notable doesn ' t mean it ' s up to snuff . 	1
It also has to pass the parity test , i . e . be considered respectable among its peers . 	0
Regarding , " Also the presence of sources which support one viewpoint does not mean that contrasting viewpoint sources are needed if the contrasting sources are fringe science . 	0
See Fringe theories # Parity of sources , " I was responding to Levine ' s assertion that " when we allow some notable gray and not some other notable gray , then this article will suffer of NPOV violations . " 	0

I honestly don ' t understand why this is so controversial ; after all nobody gets in a huff about the United States of America ' s founding date being 1776 , when the history of the American people precedes that date by over a century . 	0
In fact , there was no country or state prior to 1910 with the structure and geographical area of the Union , which is why that date is universally regarded as the date on which South Africa as it exists today was " born " . 	0
I have read the links you provided , but they have revealed to me nothing beyond what I already know . 	0
I think this is a fairly important point , since it has an impact on the dates we include in this article . 	1
The ZAR was subsumed into the Union of South Africa in 1910 , it did not become the Union . 	0
Which is that the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and the modern Republic of South Africa are distinct and separate political entities with no similarity in political structure or geographical area . 	0

The specific query raised here was which date given as South Africa ' s foundation date was correct , and that is what the discussion has mostly been about . 	0
As I have explained Mormonism , without this First Vision , is like trying to talk about the US Revolution without mentioning King George or the British Empire . 	0

Obama has also taken full responsibility for it which attaches the whole incident to his " presidential hip " . 	0
It ' s the largest oil spill in U . S . history , that ' s not minor . 	0
Quite probably ; if it does , then that would be what would be relevant to mention here , if Obama used this moment of crisis to set a new or accelerated course . 	0
If he doesn ' t , then that could be what would be relevant to mention , that despite this major incident we soldiered on with the drilling because ( the public / Southern governors / the oil industry complained that the loss of oil industry jobs was worse for the economy and the country than the possibility of future such accidents ? ) and as a result we were ( just fine / experienced a few more but as with terrorism under George W . Bush , that became the new normal / were utterly devastated by a series of catastrophes that ended life as we know it ) . 	0
That ' s the problem with news , it ' s just news until it ' s history . 	0
We could fight any mention of the spill , or we could acknowledge that unlike other distractions this is a real thing with likely real repercussions in the real world , and err on the side of making this section , you know , bigger than the automaker rescue and almost as big as health care ( both of which are also still unfolding and yet to be added to or updated ) . 	0
At such time as there is a clear culprit for the cause , we could then focus on that and drop one or even two of the other company names in this bio version of the story , but until such time , that would be irresponsible . 	0
At such time as the commission announces measures and Obama enacts them , we can shift the focus of those mentions to that enactment . 	0
At such time as there is a real and understood shift in energy or environmental policy , we might drop a couple other issues to note that . 	0
If someone wants to remove the criticism that Obama and the federal government should do more , we can whittle down some of what he ' s done , but if we did that , people would arrive re-adding that aspect . 	0
Do not use inflammatory language against another editor . 	0
I ' ll say it again , if someone wants to remove the whole thing pending something that actually has major relevance to Obama ' s biography , I will not object at all . 	0

I am not pushing anything other than we adhere to NPOV and get the story right . 	0
If Popper indeed did not characterize Darwinism as pseudoscience , then we should definitely not include such a characterization . 	0

- Well , I can ' t speak for Wikiscient , but I assume it ' s for the same reasons I stated here repeatedly : The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war - this also applies to the Pope image , another very specific case of death . 	0
Let ' s toss those non-biologists then ! 	0
We need a new section soon , this is getting lengthy . 	1
Whether an oil-painting or the photograph of a real human skull , as suggested by Nk . sheridan above ( at the bottom of the paragraph " Lead image question again " ) , I don ' t really care . 	0

The same applies to the Inquisition figure . 	0
If you say 3-4 , 000 were probaby executed - when ? 	0
The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context . 	1
Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1
If you look at the image in full resolution , the death of the soldier depicted is rather obvious - but the lead image should obviously and broadly stand for death at first glance . 	0
Also , is " death " the first thing the soldier picture evokes ? 	0
Just off a random google search , something like : Gitmo or Obamacare — Preceding unsigned comment added by 	0

So what specifically do you want to add or change ? 	0
This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0
This inclusion criteria of this article relies on notability of the source - not relevance or influence in the real world . 	0

If SadKermit ( or any other parody ) is itself notable , then create a page for it ( " notability of a topic " being the threshold for a page to exist ) . 	1

That ' s a good distinction , Scarecroe … the thing may be notable , but that notability does not seem to be in relation to the page here . 	0

Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0
Remember , this article includes entries which are NOT definitively pseudoscience - entries which per PSCI we cannot label as such even in their own articles . 	0
Since we are dealing with notable characterizations , there is no excuse for dismissing Scientology ' s characterizations . 	0
This is not a " list of pseudosciences " but rather a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience " . 	0
However , this article is not about definitively labelling any topic as pseudoscience , but rather just including topics which have been characterized as pseudoscience by some notable source . 	0
Enric , I personally agree with you re : Scientology ' s not being reliable at labelling something definitively as pseudoscience . 	0
As such , we should not exclude their views from this article - as per NPOV . 	0

This means that if there is a consensus to categorize a topic in Category : Pseudoscience , then that same consensus could be applied to include the topic in " List of pseudosciences " . 	0
Absolutely . 	0
There will always be grey . 	0

It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1
Fearful of this happening to them , Catholics supported tough measures against protestants - who weren ' t fighting for religious toleration , but for their right to impose their religion on everyone else . 	0

It ' s inappropriate and undue weight to mention BP several times and the other companies not at all when it was Transocean who owned , staffed and operated , and was responsible for , the drilling of the well and the drilling rig that exploded ( and lost 11 crew ) and it was Halliburton contractors who had done the vital job of cementing , particularly given that faulty cementing by Halliburton was alleged to be a factor in two other major blowouts . 	1
Both of those companies figured about as prominently as BP in several Congressional hearings , and it is conceivable that one or both will ultimately be found partly if not fully responsible for the blowout . 	0
So the question is , surely , whether NI remained in the UKGBI in 1922 . 	0
Northern Ireland was in the UKGBI between 1922 til 1927 when UK was renamed as UKGBNI . 	0
It ' s undue weight and out of context if we were to mention people expressed frustration at the president without noting that there was even more frustration being expressed toward BP et al . On the other hand , it ' s similarly undue weight and out of context to note frustration and perception and not to give an adequate picture of what was really going on , either before or after , as reliably sourced , and further , to give it in a timeline as it actually happened and not as the storyline in the media has played out . 	1
It would be absurd to note this happened without noting BP ' s failure to stop this early , as their plan suggested they could and would ; yet at the same time , it would be inappropriate to note their failures without noting that they eventually had success in capturing a huge amount of oil , considering they were capturing absolutely none of it for over a month . 	0
It ' s essentially slander to keep naming BP as though they ' re the only company involved , while ignoring the other companies at the heart of this . 	0
I have left out Anadarko , despite the fact they own 25% of the well and 25% of the oil , and the Japanese company who owns 10% , despite the fact that more than 1 / 3 of the oil involved in this is not owned by BP , and I have left out Cameron International who manufactured the blowout protector , , as it was past the warrantee period and it has come to light that Transocean modified the BOP counter which voids Cameron ' s responsibility . 	1
And of course , once you ' re going to note more than one event , you need to establish a timeline Frankly , as I said when I first edited this section , I don ' t think any of this is really relevant to this bio yet . 	1

Smith , according to his own account , told local clergy about the First Vision and was mocked and scorned over the pulpit in his own community shortly after it had happened . 	1
If his own accounts are not enough , his mother ' s journal , as well as other sources including local newspapers all support this idea . 	0
I still believe that the newspaper articles are appropriate to the discussion specifically because they challenge certain preconceived notions about pre-1900 Mormonism . 	1
Dismissing one academic because one has supposedly taken a class and considers him to be less " mainstream " than the current thought does not change his academic credentials . 	0
Together they do support the idea that Smith did claim to have a vision much earlier than I have read some believe . 	0
Witnesses from two or three sources are enough for a claim to stand up in a court of law , but apparently not here though ? 	0
I have heard arguments that have attempted to dismiss all three of these witness separately , but upon investigation I have not found them credible . 	0

Are we getting rid of evidence BECAUSE it doesn ' t support our preferred conclusions ? 	0
I am also surprised at the apparent concern for adding something that showed that Smith had been publicly scorned for his claims . 	0

This was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led some to accuse him of anti-Semitism . [ 28 ] He has later denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] 	0
{ { editsemiprotected } } the intro to the article reads   : He also been falsely [ 24 ] accused in much of the West over a comment he made in against the " Zionist entity " to be " wiped off the map . " 	0
In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0
also , false is a needless judgement when the facts of the matter are a click away . 	1
also the words " much " are ommitable i suggest that this sentence will be true to the facts of the matter and invite people to continue and read the appropriate section . 	0

You probably feel that a section about Jolie ' s tattoos is trivial detail , but I feel that they are notable enough to be mentioned ( seeing as they are a big part of her life . . . and career if you count how they are emphasized in one or two of her films ) . 	1

A lot of these celebrities are also well-known for their romantic relationships , such as Brad Pitt and Jolie . 	0
I do not feel that having a section about that , as long as it ' s well-sourced and well-worded ( and appropriate ) , is unencyclopedic . 	0
I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0
I get your point somewhat . 	0
But to say that Personal life sections ( which by the way , do not have to be titled Personal life , as noted with the Angelina Jolie article ) should not or should rarely be included in Wikipedia is something that I do not agree with . 	0

This does not exonerate the Catholic Church but I think it indicates more of a cultural problem that can not be discounted . 	1
The US Dept of Education report also found that in order to avoid bad press , the principals of the schools where the abuse happened would often not report the abuse or prosecute the teacher but allowed them to be transferred to new schools . 	0
Such figures led her to contend " the physical sexual abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by priests . " 	0
That compares with about five decades of cases of abusive priests . 	0
Extrapolating data from the latter , she estimated roughly 290 , 000 students experienced some sort of physical sexual abuse by a school employee from a single decade — 1991-2000 . 	0
To support her contention , Shakeshaft compared the priest abuse data with data collected in a national survey for the American Association of University Women Educational Foundation in 2000 . 	0
" So we think the Catholic Church has a problem ? " she told industry newspaper Education Week in a March 10 interview . 	0
Charol Shakeshaft , the Hofstra University scholar who prepared the report , said the number of abuse cases — which range from unwanted sexual comments to rape — could be much higher . 	0
According to a draft report commissioned by the U . S . Department of Education , in compliance with the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " act signed into law by President Bush , between 6 percent and 10 percent of public school children across the country have been sexually abused or harassed by school employees and teachers . 	0
" Now , on the heels of the Catholic abuse scandal comes another of historic proportions — one that has the potential to be much greater and far-reaching . 	0

I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0

If nothing passes muster here on Talk , I am clearly OK with not mentioning it in the lede at all , but the effort is worth it , an ounce of prevention . . . 	0
So as to avoid making the perfect the enemy of the good , I would strongly suggest drafting a way to mention it in the lede , even if only a very minimal mention , so as to discourage such understandable but in the end not helpful edits . 	1
While I fully agree with the concerns of recentism and historical balance ( consider in 1000 years what this article would look like : this flap would barely get a footnote if that ! ) , I also recognize the empirical reality Karanacs and others have mentioned , that if no mention is made in the lede , editors less informed about the editorial issues here will even in good faith bombard it with edits to mention it . 	0

Very few would say that about Sabbath , either . 	0

Grand Funk is now often very highly regarded as an early hard rock group and influence to heavy metal music ( which they were actually described as during their early years , by the way ) . 	0
It ' s odd that you should suddenly advocate the same critics who you so unreasonably revile for having described Zeppelin and other bands as ' metal . ' 	0

The term apparently did exist by that point ( the first use by a critic according to this article was in 1968 ) , though it seemingly ( again , according to this article and its sources ) wasn ' t used by a writer in a context ( relatively ) in line with its current until 1971 on Sir Lord Baltimore . 	0
" Highway Star " and " War Pigs " are kind of hard to compare in my opinion . 	0
They represent the foundation of different camps in metal . 	0
I don ' t really think it started with Burn for Deep Purple . 	0
I think maybe anywhere from In Rock to Machine Head could have been it , though I think their ' 60s material was much more exclusively hard rock . 	0
" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

Logically then , I ' m not sure where you ' re coming up with this definition of the word . 	0
According to Princeton ' s definition , for example , a critic can be defined simply as " someone who frequently finds fault or makes harsh and unfair judgments " . 	0
Regardless of whether it is fact-based ( and I have my doubts ) , supported by ' legitimate editors ' ( I notice you are going to try and disqualify some of the many editors who have in the past brought this up ) , and regardless of whether it is a fringe theory , it can still be discussed if notable and reliably sourced . 	1

So is Israel given so much aid in cash or is it given so many aircraft , missiles etc ? 	0

It may be true or not , I choose to believe it another day when I see it myself , but I am more familiar with Sabbath ' s influences , and I ' ve seen Ozzy on interview saying that " there was no such thing as heavy metal back then " ; it was on a heavy metal documentary called " From Black Sabbath to System of a Down " , outlining a timeline for heavy metal . 	0
It was quite MTV-flashy , but surprisingly accurate , and it mentioned how Black Sabbath were set aside bands like Zeppelin and Purple because of their very different style , and stressed their sole importance . 	0

I really really like the new Inquisition paragraph . 	0
This is such an important paragraph to have in this article because it is something that has been used as anti-Catholic propaganda for centuries and historians are in agreement that it has been a tool of misinformation even to the present day . 	1

In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

you obviously would like to use " international political definitions " when it suits your position ( as you just stated ) but will ignore these same references when your position is refuted ( as stated above with the U .

As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0

As for etymologies , as I note above , you clearly had no problem with keeping in the article the fact that the word referring to the animal has changed in English because you didn ' t remove the mention of it in your original edit . 	1
Therefore I fail to see how taking the logical next step and explaining why this happened , with multiple reliable sources to back it up , is a problem . 	0
Regarding the " jarring " nature of the word . . . look , I can sympathise . 	0
I understand it ' s an offensive word . 	0
Maybe slightly more so in American English than British English as you indicate , but by no means is it something you ' d say in conversation with an elderly relative in the UK   ; ) However , as I am sure you are very much aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	1

Please , let ' s assume good will and discuss this matter here . 	0
You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0
That ' s fairly obvious , just like a history or pattern of lies , misbehavior or criminal behavior by Hamas would be relevant when they seemed to state a similar lie in 2008 or were accused of similar misbehavior or criminal behavior in 2008 or 2009 . 	0
But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0

With regard to the English reformation , things like the disembowelment of priests , the Pilgrimage of Grace , the Prayer Book rebellion , the Northern Rising and the massacres of catholics that followed haven ' t been mentioned . 	0

If a company makes sprockets , it doesn ' t need to be recognized as a sprocket company by any government in order for an encyclopedia to say that it makes sprockets . 	0
Hamas habitually engages in terrorist activites , as explicitly noted by the entries in both the Britannica and Encarta encyclopedias , which are linked to from the article . 	1
Sure , it would be plagiarism , but it would make a better article and allow many of us to avoid spending our precious time on this earth in Wikipedia battles . 	0
It would be nice if we could just copy the article on Hamas from a real encyclopedia and paste it here . 	1

Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0
Instead of the painting ( which I inserted after suggesting it here and receiving no response for several days ) I would also agree with any other image of a human skull , although I think that the painting is very fitting . 	0
The dead Gettysburg soldier is too specific for a lead image : this is not death in general , it ' s the death of a soldier in war . 	1

I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0

My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0
We can ' t allow some characterizations made by one kind of notable source but disallow other characterizations made by another kind of notable source . 	0
This is a blatant breach of NPOV . 	0
The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1

Your point may be valid in a few hundred years at the least , when continuous demographic changes will finally have an impact . 	0

Multiple users have agreed with me on this point , so I encourage you to expand your horizons a bit — realize there are more specific articles on WP than this one about the First Vision and how Smith was treated in the 1830s — and target your edits about specific details to articles that are about the specific events . 	0

There were no criticisms of the Catholic Church in Latin America - every book spoke of the Church taking a stand in every age against the abuses brought upon the people by the Spanish conquistadores and others . 	0

Black Sabbath did all of those things way before Priest did ; I was mainly referring to their fifth album " Sabbath Bloody Sabbath " , which , I strongly state , has no blues influences , hence , discarding blues in heavy metal before Judas Priest , which this article falsely states . 	0

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

My comments about using McBrien have only to do with his perception among the Catholic community as being somewhat of a rebel theologian and it is difficult to have his books listed in the beliefs section for that reason . 	0
Mike apology accepted . 	0
They claimed for many days that IDF bombed the school , and when they were proven wrong - the bombing was outside the school - they claimed that ' s what they said all along , which is a complete and utter lie . 	0
It ' s good that you ' re mentioning a school - for a great demonstration of the UN ' s commitment to accuracy and truth , read about Al-Fakhura school incident . 	0
Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur sources provide a higher level of quality in creating the Beliefs section and representing that content as being approved by the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like for my two sources to be respected because of this designation and because they adhere to Wikipedia policy . 	0
Iommi has been very public about influence from Clapton . 	0
He just had a dispute with Rev . Wright . 	0
However , Obama never abandoned his religion or said he changed it . 	0
Part of the problem in real life ( not saying it ' s here ) is that some want to defend Obama so much that they think he abandoned the church and want to wipe it out . 	0
Obama ' s dispute was with Rev . Wright , not the religion . 	0
The excuse is that it has been discussed before but what Mr . Saturn says makes sense , that he is United Church of Christ or Protestant . 	0
This is strange that it list Christianity . 	1
I didn ' t suggest removing the Ireland flag . 	1

There ' s nothing democratic about a nation where the ruling party came to power via fraud and keeps power the same way . 	0
It is obscene to classify South Africa as a ' liberal democracy ' when their leader is a lifelong member of the communist party and frequently talks about the people , the masses , peoples liberation , etc . Furthermore F . W . De Klerk himself even came out and said the 1994 election was rife with fraud . 	1
With a lifelong member of the South African communist party in power , and communisty party officials frequently invited to attend national conferences and speak at public events , it seems that South Africa ' s government is increasingly taking on a communist appearance . 	0
South Africa ' s government is no different than that of Zimbabwe , a de facto one party state by virtue of fraud , lies , violence , and corruption . 	0

I don ' t know if they ' re moving towards a centrally planned economy but classifying South Africa as a communist country instead of a liberal democracy is more appropriate , at least it deserves consideration . 	0
I nominate the paragraph on the Veleia inscriptions for deletion . 	0
First things they covered were Zeppelin and Sabbath . 	0
the article is POV , i was denied multiple times to try to balance it , i did so while discussing it on the discussion page . 	0
I dont think it detracts from the article to have this in here - it just shows the weakness of the opposing opinion and I prefer to have this exposed . 	0
The radio programme quoted above is similar to other stuff produced on this page in that it contains no hard facts . 	0
There is no scandal here in the UK despite many journalists looking for one . 	0
It is primarily a US scandal , and , despite trawling the internet , no-one has produced evidence of any widespreaad world scandal . 	0
The " scandal " is not " worldwide . 	1
I have also noticed that the lead mention has expanded as i have predicted , and it will be cut . 	0
I ' ve looked at the major Wikipedia RCC articles in other languages and none even discuss this so-called worldwide scandal , let alone have it in the lead . 	0
This does not a worldwide scandal make , however , however much some people might wish one . 	0

There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0
5 ) Iranian universities were closed from 1980 to 1983 due to the post-revolution anarchy . 	0
4 ) Even if Ahmadinejad had taken the entrance exam in 1990 with almost double population than his time in 1976 , he would have ranked among 150 , 000 and not 400 , 000 ! ! ! 	0
This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0
The statistics shows that almost always 1 / 5 apply to engineering programs , 2 / 5 social sciences and 2 / 5 medicals . 	0
It ' s clear they will never admit it , so it has to be highlighted publicly . 	0
Yeah , there are so many double standards on this article , and this website in general that it would take a massive overhaul of the whole system to clear out the bias of these " editors . " 	0
Yes , we shouldn ' t base our information on sources that are biased in the other direction . 	0
On the other hand , a quick glance here shows no mention that there is currently any link between the AGI and PPFA , nor that there has been since 1977 , when " the Alan Guttmacher Institute was incorporated as an independent , not-for-profit organization " . 	0
There is no vandalism . 	0
Unless you have some to back up your assertions , this discussion is a dead end . 	0
" Constant internet debate " is irrelevant here . 	1
Only reliable secondary sources matter . 	0
This is heading in an unnecessary and unproductive direction . 	0
In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
And to what end ? 	0
It is not our job here on this page to clean up the Bush article or speculate about what makes Bush a controversial figure , but if it is misfocused you are free to go there and try to improve it . 	0

How exactly is the term " pro-life " not " Catholic " ? 	0
As far as I know the term is a concise encapsulation of the Church ' s stance on these issues . 	0
Still , I can see how the article can be improved through something like your suggested edits . 	0

To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0
Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0

Maybe an article about weapon unloading . 	0
Maybe in another article , although I can ' t think of one where it would be directly relevant at this point . 	0
Therefore , it should not be in such a visible article . 	0
It is clear that anyone not living in Israel would not correctly interpret this picture . 	0
The patrol is in the territories , so the locals would obviously be settlers , but this is not about " cooperation with settler groups " . 	0
From what I can tell from the picture , it ' s a joint patrol / weapon unloading by the IDF and local security forces , and this has nothing to do with the " settlement movement " or anything of the sort . 	0
The above comment shows exactly why this picture shouldn ' t be in this article , as it can be broadly , and incorrectly , interpreted . 	1
The object of a " theory " is to enduce debate , which in turn stimulates research and which in return bears fruit in the form of a " fact " , creativity is more important that knowledge ( " Einstein " ) . 	0

While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
Please propose textual edits so the discussion can center around concrete improvements to the associated article without distraction from nebulous prolixity . 	0

Entropy1 , don ' t let me discourage you from trying to improve this article , but in this case I think you are trying to introduce conclusions that are not supported by mainstream scholars , including Mormon mainstream historians like Richard Bushman . 	0
Given the nature and history of this article , it would have been nice if PoV-concerns had been mooted and potentially resolved here first , but water over the bridge . 	0
But the proposed material here , such as the newspaper articles , is not appropriate in this article . 	1
The First Vision is a very important part of post-1900 Mormonism . 	0
if the tone of my edits was not neutral ( this is how X is called by Y ) , or if my attempt to clarify the reasoning of ( X ) why it / they use this name were offending , then that should be discussed on this page or modified accordingly in the article ! 	0
but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
I agree . 	0
It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
Though I deeply respect my former professor Anderson , I don ' t think we can make much use of his BYU Studies article in Wikipedia , given that no non-Mormon scholar agrees with the underlying conclusion of his article . 	1
frankly I ' m offended by you calling my edits vandalism ! 	0
but i would rather keep the discussion revolving around the core issue of this discussion . 	0
Thus , Obama ' s and most other Democrats pages stay clean . 	0
They simply put you , me or anybody else who tries for a legitimate edit , through what is obviously a run-around , until we give up . 	0
They are clearly biased . 	0
