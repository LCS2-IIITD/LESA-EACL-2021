The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0

Instead of choosing military targets , they target civilians , in order to terrorize the population to get what they want . 	0
They choose to pursue their cause by murdering civilians , with no military use . 	0
As I ' ve explained , their method of willful , intentional killing of civilians is the most salient and important detail about them . 	1
I didn ' t say " Hamas is a terrorist organization " ( though it is ) , but that it employs clear-cut terrorist tactics , which is 100% true and accurate , and not open to interpretation . 	0

" 	0
Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1

Do the two different forms of mass need to be discussed in detail in this article ? 	1

IMO , this is not an appropriate place to make cursory mention of fields and theories because they once were referred to as pseudoscience by somebody , and not a place to do a quaint historical analysis of instances where , say , theories that were at some point in time alleged by somebody to be pseudoscientific turned out later to have merit after scientific method came to be fully applied to those theories . 	1
At a minimum , if there are going to be such historical observations included , they should be clarified as historical with a cogent note to the reader about the circumstances under which they were once characterized as such . 	0

After all even 600 days without antiretroviral drug treatment no sign of the HIV virus of any strain was found in blood , bone marrow , or bowel . 	0
The fact though that Huetter ' s patient also had CXCR4 virus at low levels before the treatment means that this statement may be wrong . 	0

However , terms like denialism , misrepresentation and distortion are how main view scientists have received theories differing from HIV causing AIDS . 	0
The issue at hand , if one is going to give any lip service to dissent , is the fact that some * scientists * dissent . 	0
So , when describing a controversy that has been given the label " denialism " ( a contortion of the English language ) , why is it a " misrepresentation " or " distortion " of a * scientific * WP article to focus on * scientists * in that section ? 	0
Everyone knows that all sorts of non-scientists have differing views about HIV , including millions of people who totally accept the " single direct cause " paradigm that is mainstream . 	0
The term is used only by partisan sources , that if we would quote or state every deformation they express we would have racist and antisemitic hate speech such as " Zionazies " , " Jews are jerms " ( Sheikh Raed Salah , the Islamic Movement ( Israel ) " and we had to open the Holocaust value by " called Zionist Fraud by . . . .

Shlomi ' s right that the earth won ' t overheat so long as it can continue to radiate in infrared into space , but there are mechanisms for trapping heat on earth - the greenhouse effect is the major one , and in our case , the biosphere is another obvious one . 	1
It ' s not quite correct to treat the Earth as a blackbody , since the atmosphere has a confounding effect - we might say that the Earth acts as a blackbody above the level of the atmosphere , but actually the amount of radiation emitted is inconsistent with the surface temperature of earth . 	1
It ' s just unneeded detail , and it ' s been added in a sloppy way that interrupts the flow of the article . 	0
Of course the event of the First Vision is relevant to this article , but what is not particularly relevant is pointing out that newspapers were making fun of Smith in 1829 for claiming to have seen God . 	0

Angling for anything earlier than that , e . g . a line that straight-out says " Hamas is a terrorist organization " will not fly per words to avoid guidelines . 	1

Also , 189 . 140 , what do you think of the story , documented on the wikipedia page for Gaddafi ' s son , Saif al-Islam Muammar Al-Gaddafi , that his son Saif dated the Jewish-Israeli actress Orly Weinerman , starting from the days he was attending University in London , with talk of marriage ? 	0
If Gaddafi was in the mold you describe , why was this tolerated . 	0

FTA : " Crowley had claimed to be a Freemason , but the regularity of his initiations with the United Grand Lodge of England has been disputed . [ 4 ] ^ E . g . 	0
Starr M P 2004 , " Aleister Crowley : freemason ! " , Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon , http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html , BC " The reference cited is credited the Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon , which is a different governing body than the United Grand Lodge of England . 	0
Most biographers and historians , pro or con , generally agree that Crowley was initiated to some degree as a Freemason . 	0
Just because some guy in Canada eighty years later doesn ' t want Crowley associated with Freemasonry doesn ' t make it so . 	0

But I ' m doubting , from your selected image , that a used tampon is what you had in mind . . . or am I wrong ? 	0
Would you consider that acceptable ? 	0
You ' re thinking of this . 	0
As far as the picture is concerned : ANYTHING is better then nothing . 	1
Yes , it ' s nonsense ; that ' s why those of us who watch this page revert it every time it gets added to the page . 	0
Showing abortion can also be showing a tiny clot on a used tampon , or alternately , bloody , reassembled , parts of a 140 day old fetus . 	0
It might be better showing a used tampon over nothing , I suppose … 	0

Halford and Dunn ' s opinions were used as a reference to depict a certain viewpoint in the Traditional Heavy Metal article . 	0
Well , here are my two cents about what to cut ( based on what seems out of place for a lead , not based on any numeric target for length ) : 1 ) sentence starting " Previous names " ( none of these are in wide use today ) , 2 ) sentence starting " HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4 + T cells " ( too much detail for the lead ) , 3 ) somehow merge the paragraph starting " Eventually most HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS . " with the mentions elsewhere about opportunistic infections , antiretrovirals , etc ( I ' m not as sure about how to do this one ) . 	0
I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes . [ 161 ] " Also , I ' m changing the wording back about South Africa ' s AIDS denialism ; phrasing it as HIV-AIDS link makes it sound like the link is shakey or something . 	0
As I have explained Mormonism , without this First Vision , is like trying to talk about the US Revolution without mentioning King George or the British Empire . 	0
I believe that it does belong here , references included so that it is not removed for other reasons . 	0
It seems to me that you simply don ' t want to include this as an inconvenient troubling fact about Mormonism . 	0
Please explain to me your thought on why it does not belong here . 	0
As for the epidemiology , it does seem like a lot of numbers , but we should hit high points like the huge impact on Africa ( I ' ve trimmed a bit of the language but it could probably be shorter still ) . 	0
I am not trying to push my POV here whatsoever ( which would be that Darwinism is scientific ) . 	0
I am rather pushing for NPOV by requesting ( demanding even ! ) that we represent fairly , and as far as possible without bias , all significant views . 	0

I am not pushing anything other than we adhere to NPOV and get the story right . 	0
If Popper indeed did not characterize Darwinism as pseudoscience , then we should definitely not include such a characterization . 	0
That said , I am fairly certain that we can find other notable sources more clearly characterizing Darwinsim , neo-Darwinism and / or social Darwinism as pseudoscientific , and when we do , we should include those characterization in this list . 	0
As an aside , I personally believe in natural selection and I am a devout agnostic . 	0

And I ' m still not seeing any actual evidence which suggests that GNU was axiomatically important for kernel development in a way which necessitates bringing this up so strongly in the intro . 	0
This can certainly be argued for things like gcc , but not the userspace . 	0
And further , this doesn ' t defend the old wording , which gave a whole paragraph of the intro over to the development of GNU rather than the Linux kernel . 	0
The homosexuality issue cannot be removed . 	0

The wod " controversies " cannot be removed ; there are controversies . 	0
Homosexuals cannot be priests . 	0
While such an analysis should clearly be included in the article , is the lede better for it being there ? 	0
The bit about sex scandals cannot be removed ; they are burned into the public consciousness , and were major news for a very long time . 	0
As it is a more significant change I am considering , I wish for some feedback first . 	0
I ask as I have been doing some minor tidying up of the lede , hopefully to read better and to shorten slightly without losing any important content . 	0
The Hadza language for example sticks out for being non-Bantu in a sea of Bantu , or the Brahui language which is equally surrounded by IE . 	0
In Western Europe , using IE or non-IE as a comparative yardstick is acceptable . 	0
It has scientific relevance , it denotes linguistic ( and to some extent cultural ) continuity for a certain timespan for example . 	0
I don ' t see a problem with the term . 	1
These are important facts . 	0
Once again read the article . 	0
If three major newspapers have written articles about this , it ' s notable . 	0

If you want to introduce changes - fine . 	0
I strongly suggest , then , that you post your proposed changes here first , allow some discussion , then introduce them , rather than just making a string of edits . 	0
Look at the prior archive 11 , for example , for a long discussion on the wording of the disambiguation whatnot . 	0
You replaced that agreed wording with " make disambig less of a mess . " 	0

Can people point to sources that say " Hamas is not a terrorist organization ? " 	0
I don ' t think it ' s helpful to think of it in terms of " many , many more [ governments ] do not consider [ Hamas ] a terrorist organization . " 	1
A lot of governments - - possibly most governments - - simply aren ' t interested in making any such distinction or pronouncement , whatever their " real " feelings on the matter . 	0
It certainly doesn ' t need it now . 	0
The scandal is prominently enough mentioned in its due position 	0
It would make the Us scandal one of the key incidents in Christian history ! 	0
The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead . 	0
Placing it in the lead gives it undue prominence in relevance to the church . 	0
This is the first time such a demand has been made , and it is utterly unreasonable . 	1
There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article . 	0
Unless similar things appear in the leads for all other religious organisations and secular ones too . 	0
I will no longer be engaging in this conversation . 	0

Wikipedia is about sharing information , and I plan to share plenty of knowledge on this article . 	0
You are guarding this article as if it is yours . 	0
Also , Brown Haired girl , I don ' t see on Wikipedia that it ' s necessary to always ' compromise ' - sometimes certain people want to imply a position to push a zealous political agenda , and that is something that is very hard to compromise with ( and should not be done ) 	1
The added benefit here is that you don ' t have any PoV implications . 	0
In a summary ( that is supposed to be simple ) why confuse and mislead the reader with unimportant technicalities that are absolutely meaningless in the long run ? 	0
The situation was straightforward and very simple : Therefore , north stays and south leaves . 	0
Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1
Why in a summary are there no details about many of the other events during the Viking and Norman ages , but for this particular event you feel compelled to add minute and misleading detail . 	0
O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0
I understand your frustration but there ' s nothing that can be done about it . 	1
Wikipedia will never be completely neutral because collectively , editors are biased . 	0
- - 	0
The musicians I mentioned ( I actually forgot to mention Sebastian Bach as well ) not only cite Zeppelin as an influence , but have called Zep a metal band ( Åkerfeldt called them a metal band here for instance . ) 	0
You miss took what I said about bands citing them . 	0
The reader understands that countries beyond that list don ' t label Hamas as such . 	0
I still stand by " Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band " . 	0
I agree . 	0
But with all the biased editors no progress will ever be made in making the articles impartial . 	0
Why bother trying ? 	0
Now then , if this was merely an " List of pseudosciences " , then this would be another matter . 	0
Disallowing CCHR ' s point of view , clearly violates NPOV . 	0
CCHR has characterized psychiatry as a pseudoscience . 	0
A characterization is a point of view . 	0
Right or wrong in their characterization , there is no denying that CCHR is a significant organization which has characterized psychiatry as pseudoscience . 	0
CCHR is a significant organization . 	0
Much appreciated . 	0
@Enric - Thanks for refactoring . 	0
This is not an article which list things that are pseudoscience ; rather it is an article which list things that have been characterized as pseudoscience . 	0
My thought here is that since this is merely an article of significant points of view , that CCHR is in fact a reliable source of their organization ' s point of view . 	0
That Hamas is classified as a terrorist organization by several nations is brought up at the end of the first paragraph . 	0
Everyone knows that AMG has an absolutely stunning track record , and isn ' t frequently met with disdain here at the ol ' Wikifactory . 	0

AllMusic Guide is a shoddy source , you say ? 	0
And ohmygawrsh ! 	0
Very few would say that about Sabbath , either . 	0
Very few would say that Grand Funk was the smartest band ever or the most technically talented . 	0
Grand Funk is now often very highly regarded as an early hard rock group and influence to heavy metal music ( which they were actually described as during their early years , by the way ) . 	0
It ' s odd that you should suddenly advocate the same critics who you so unreasonably revile for having described Zeppelin and other bands as ' metal . ' 	0
What ' s more , your dismissal of Grand Funk Railroad is neither relevant , nor factual . 	1
Revan , Sabbath is listed on that page for hard rock . 	0

It still doesn ' t have much to do with Obama ' s biography , quite frankly . 	1

Until then , it is better covered under Presidency of Barack Obama and BP . 	0

I have fixed it twice . 	0
The opening line should read " the 44th , and current President . 	1

" 44th " , and " current " , are not synonymous . 	0
He is also the current POTUS , which he will eventually not be . 	0

As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0
That is over 1 billion people challenging the controversy of an athiest pro-death stance ( see how easy words can be twisted to suit a POV ? ) . 	1

Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0
Anything that can be depicted visually is better written in descriptive text . 	0
Shock images , whether " pro-life " or " pro-choice , " serve little to no informative purpose . 	0
On the contrary , Ros , the only reason for adding such images would be ideological bias . 	1
Although the sentence is an accurate and worthy one , I would ask if it belongs in the lede ( currently near the end ) : " Although the Catholic Church believes that it is the true church founded by Jesus Christ , the church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit is active in Christian churches and communities separated from itself , and that Catholics are called by the Holy Spirit to work for unity or ecumenism among all Christians . " 	1
So , who are the Lebanese descended from ? 	0
Looking at the phenotype of most lebanese today we can tell that they obviously are not Arabs from the peninsula either . 	1
Modern genetic tests have showed that Syrians , Lebanese , Palestinians and Israelis are more closely related to each other genetically than to Arabs from the peninsula . 	0
I don ' t see your point here . . 	0
I refer you to the section on Palestinian ancestry here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian#The_ancestry_of_the_Palestinians Read there to see that the predominant view of most historians is that populations in the Levant adopted the Arabic language and most of them were not descended from Arabs . 	1

people say different things at different times and its here that we discuss it and log it . do you really think that this article should change according to the last ever quote of AM regarding the holocaust ? 	0
if so i think youll find your argument failing . 	0
And this article clearly states that he said that and claimes so . however , since erasing the past is not possible , the claim he made at 2005 is still denial . 	1
if you wish to open a section right after the section about holocaust denial that reads " AM States the holocaust did in fact happen " and link sources that support it you are welcome . 	0

I agree that going forwards the tree diverges , but that does not indicate a universal common descent , but rather indicates a mechanisms of evolution . 	0
Rather , going backwards , looking at the tree converge one finds that it all ( with high probability ) comes back to one ancestor . 	0

It would be a bit like me saying there is a problem with defining " Israel " , as some incredibly fringey publications are under the impression it includes the West Bank ( including E . Jerusalem ) , Gaza and the Golan . 	0
That term , " occupied Palestinian territory " , has a very specific and well-defined meaning . 	0
It has been used that way by some people , but that is a fringe view , sort of on the level of fringeyness as saying that E . Jerusalem is not occupied Palestinian territory . 	0
No . 	1

I don ' t really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier ( though again a more " neutral " John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better ) . 	0
If you want to put up a morgue or med-school shot of some anonymous " John / Jane Doe " corpse , I ' d probably be okay with that ( depending in that case however entirely on how likely it seems that some reader out there might be surprised and disturbed to see a deceased relative or loved-one representing this topic - - which again is just another aspect of the same reasoning and in the same way something that Wikipedia probably ought to avoid here . . . ) . 	0
Close-up of JFK ' s head-wound : problem . 	0

The lead image should be a good representation of the subject of this article . 	0
As far as my " disapproval " of the dead-Pope image ( and " similarly " the dead-soldier image ) : it ' s not squeamishness , it ' s just the same reason why I thought the painting would be more " appropriate " here cropped down to just the skull . 	1
That ' s all . 	0
Choosing a lead image that also contains representations of the subjects of other articles weakens the effect , is distracting , is potentially confusing , and depending on the " other subjects " in question might easily be interpreted as editorial bias ( to the extent , in the case of the Pope , for example , of possibly causing offense to some readers ) . 	0

but it was removed and the removal reasoning was not clarified here and the discussion was left open because chose not to take part of the discussion ! 	0
in that sense the article is not balanced , although i would say that as far as i can see , it does not introduce false information , but it defiantly shuts off a whole perspective of it ! 	1
It requires that all majority - and significant-minority views be presented fairly , in a disinterested tone , and in rough proportion to their prevalence within the source material . " , the last post in the discussion ( before my responses regarding the discussion ) was by Sean . hoyland , i confirmed to the constructive input that shows that no one but i agrees that the term IOF should be used in the intro , it is clear that this term is not welcomed by some editors , and seems offensive to some , never the less , it still represents a major perspective that the article is completely ignoring ! 	0
regardless whether we agree on it or not ! 	0
Can you please clarify how i am vandalizing the article ? 	0
but lets not get drifted off the topic here , i will quote " The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting perspectives on a topic as evidenced by reliable sources . 	0
