The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1

Galileo when facing the consensus of the " mainstream " view that the earth was the center of the universe was correct to disagree and present his evidence contradicting the accepted view of how things were . 	0

News paper evidence here of the First Vision ' s presence in young Smith ' s community ( and pre-1900 ' s Mormonism ) is relevant because it allows the reader a better opportunity to understand the basis of Mormonism for themselves . 	0

Yes , because they are very-well known and have sold many albums ; but more importantly because the bulk of their music itself is in majority straight in line with heavy metal music tradition . 	0

Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

It just seems to stupid to censor content that speaks no message other then " This is an abortion . " . 	1
I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0
Pictures displayed matter-of-factly that somehow evoke pity or sympathy do not mean that they can ' t ever be displayed without sharing a point ; they just draw upon innate emotions . 	0
As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0
The picture is only as POV as the messages following it as I ' ve seen many proponents of abortion openly share them and declare they are worthless appeal to emotion in the context of abortion debate . 	1
Regardless , they ' re neutral outside debate and it ' s curious an entire article on ABORTION has no picture of such despite the fact they clearly exist . 	0

Nowhere in this Wiki are there references to the original publications claiming to have isolated HIV . 	0
I also agree that there should be two separate pages : One for HIV , and another for AIDS , as while they may be intrinsically linked in the cause and effect consensus , they are NOT the same thing . 	1
There are people who test HIV + who have NEVER developed AIDS and these case start in the 80 ' s . 	0

It has been strenuously argued that as Ahmadinejad ' s own website translated the speech as " wiped of the map " that that is the term that should be used here , despite RS ' s translating it correctly as " eliminated from the pages of history " , similarly Ahmadinejad ' s website also says " the regime occupying Jerusalem " . 	0
You rejected the RS to support wiped off the map because his own website says that but you then object to using occupying regime because you want to use Zionist regime . 	0

from the official NY-Times translation he said : " Our dear Imam said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map and this was a very wise statement .

There are several interpretations available for what he said , but even if we ignore the contradiction . 	0
I was not able to find in the archives any reference to the " zionist entity " - all of the references that i saw were discussing " occupying Zionist regime " ( which is , needless to say , fundamentally different ) . 	1

As usual , interpreations differ , with Fox News reporting Ahmadinejad as saying the " Zionist regime " is about to die and will " soon be erased from the geographical scene " [ 3 ] and Sky News reporting Ahmadinejad calling " Israel a ' fabricated regime ' that is doomed to disappear with or without the involvement of Iran .

This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0
Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues . 	0

I ' ve seen multiple ' reliable ' sources show different views on what constitutes metal , as well . 	0
I ' ve never seen what makes ' hard rock ' debated , except in the context of whether a song or band is ' metal ' or ' hard rock ' during metal discussions . 	0
I agree that the Catholic Church did a lot more good than bad ( and still does ) . 	0
I don ' t believe that the current mentions of persecution of Catholics needs to be removed from the article . 	0
My concern is that the article as written goes into increased detail about the sufferings of Catholics and barely mentions any suffering that Catholics inflicted , which gives the impression that the RCC has been victimized throughout history ( when in fact it was one of the most powerful institutions for 1000 years ) . 	0
If the main concern is reasons of space , then let ' s just summarize the persecution of Catholics sufferings . 	0

Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U . S . / israel is logical , if this methodology ( for stating " facts " ) is used on the " Hamas " wiki page : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5182564.stm http://www.nlg.org/news/index.php?entry=entry090402-082738 http://www.humanrights-geneva.info/Israel-Lebanon-Israeli,2170 http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03iht-edbouck.2378653.html http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1055241.html http://informationclearinghouse.info/article21992.htm http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/world/middleeast/19assess.html?_r=1 http://www.indymedia.ie/article/77507 http://www.btselem.org/english/Firearms/20060613_Gaza.asp http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3660668,00.html . . . did you want more referencing israel ' s " terrorist tactics " ? ? . . . . . . my point … … … israel and Hamas are THE SAME . . . . . . as far as their " tactics " are concerned . . . . . israel , actually , WORSE if you take into account the NUMBER of civilian casualties … … so when I add to the " israel " wiki page , referenced statements about the international claims of it ' s " terrorist tactics " , I shouldn ' t expect any opposition from you , right ? 	0
Now , since neither U . S . / israel claim that thier intention is to target civilian populations , we cannot choose to believe one , while dismissing the other . 	1
I would just like the articles to be free of bias connotations . 	0
I realize I will have to support my edit to others , but seeing the extent of your contributions to the " israel " wiki page , I don ' t want to have this discussion with you all over again in another place . 	0
If I were to move the " . . . considered in part , or wholly . . . . . . . a terrorist organisation . . . . " statement to a more appropriate section in the article and don ' t get any opposition from you , then it would be more in line with the method used on the " israel " wiki page . 	0
I even like the wording used right now . . . . . . but . . . . in comparing it to the " israel " wiki page , it just makes sense to have it positioned in a different area . . . . . will you oppose this ? 	0
I don ' t feel it should be removed , quite the contrary , there is quite the evidence and references that this is a common view held by international politics about Hamas , and therefore should be included in the " Hamas " page . . . . 	0

That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0
Anyway , it ' s very unlikely that the editors would agree now to adding a criticism section , and I ' m not sure how productive a protracted discussion would be here . 	0
The why is what I ' m most interested in , and I hope you can dig up some information to add into the article so we can further elaborate on this topic , as its much needed in the body on the article . 	0

Smith , according to his own account , told local clergy about the First Vision and was mocked and scorned over the pulpit in his own community shortly after it had happened . 	1
If his own accounts are not enough , his mother ' s journal , as well as other sources including local newspapers all support this idea . 	0
I still believe that the newspaper articles are appropriate to the discussion specifically because they challenge certain preconceived notions about pre-1900 Mormonism . 	1
Dismissing one academic because one has supposedly taken a class and considers him to be less " mainstream " than the current thought does not change his academic credentials . 	0

My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0

This is a blatant breach of NPOV . 	0

Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

( edit conflict ) I agree with SarekOfVulcan - proper grammar demands two commas ( for a parenthetical phrase ) or zero commas ( for a compound modifier ) . 	0
The original wording was off base , as I believe are the comparisons to Katrina . 	0
Actually , The Christian Science Monitor is a reliable source , in almost all areas . 	0
Katrina was a natural disaster , which federal and state governments are largely responsible for aid and cleanup . 	0
Although there is surely room to be critical of the Obama administration for various reactions . 	0
Like I indicated , there is valid criticism , but it ' s probably has more to do with appearances than actual responsibility . 	1
The oil spill was a result of an entity ( BP ) , and by law BP was supposed to have a plan in place for situations just like the current one . 	0
By law and common sense . 	0
The oil companies are supposed to have the equipment and plans to deal with these situations . 	0

The plans were later shelved following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the worst oil spill in US history . " 	1
It would seem to me not unreasonable to add one sentence under Domestic policy that says something like , " Obama introduced a proposal to expand areas open to off-shore drilling on March 31 , 2010 [ 45 ] . 	1
It might be notable , and if so , its existance would seem relevant here . 	0
Works for me . 	0
Not much more than " it exists " is relevant here , so a wikilink would be the way to go . 	1
Again , you ' re incorrect about how you ' re characterizing my edits , even as your own edits bespeak a lack of understanding of ( or a lack of focus on ) the issue . 	1
The " an oil rig " wording was not created by my edit , it was created by yours . 	0
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barack_Obama&diff=prev&oldid=367249190 My wording had been " exploded a Transocean drilling rig " until Scjessey ' s complaint the section was too long after which I reduced it to " exploded a Transocean rig " , which you changed to " exploded an oil rig " , which , as I ' ve already established , created an entirely new link leading to a disambiguation page . 	0
As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

It ' s not up to us to decide what it should be . 	0
ALl that matters is that we quote reliable / verifiable sources correctly , if they use the term , we should , if they don ' t , we shouldn ' t . 	0
And , to quote further , " The biggest compliance problem the auditors discovered was training children to protect themselves from abuse . 	0
For example , USA Today - Church sex abuse costs skyrocket 07 March 2008 , which says in part that , to quote : " . . . hadn ' t reported abuse claims to civil authorities until after the lapse was discovered in the audit . " 	0

I dont think it detracts from the article to have this in here - it just shows the weakness of the opposing opinion and I prefer to have this exposed . 	0
To stop edit warring leave it out until consensus is reached , but the discussion is somewhat fragmented right now . 	0
Multiple reverts are never a good idea on this page . 	0
I don ' t think this content currently can be improved by editing , and the moment it is improved by removal as it isn ' t supported . 	0

While the LGBT population of San Francisco is certainly one of its most internationally recognizable elements , it is one aspect of the many things that are recognizable about San Francisco and should probably be included in the lead , I would prefer that all the items listed there maintain a parallel structure . 	0
The final paragraph in the lead does not need to have an overly technical representation of the gay and lesbian population of San Francisco . 	1
