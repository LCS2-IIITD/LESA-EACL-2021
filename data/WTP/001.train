It seems to me if we are reporting what Smith said , Smith ' s own writings are probably the best possible source . 	0
" . . . considering Smiths own writings it is not more accurate " Why do you say that ? 	0
He doesn ' t mention considering non-Christian faiths , so it seems natural to state that he was trying to decide which Christian church to join . " 	0
Smith said he was trying to decide between the different " sects " , and he mentions the Methodists , the Presbyterians , and so forth . 	0

Nu metal is just an umbrella term used to describe all metal bands that add elements of alternative or rap music to their music . 	0
Saying System of a Down is alternative metal and not nu metal is like saying Limp Bizkit is rap metal instead of nu metal . 	0
System of a Down is alternative metal which is a subgenre of nu metal . 	0

I view Smith ' s 1838 personal history as a good source for explaining what he said happened to him . ) 	0
( My only point was that Smith and his family were Christians at the time of the First Vision , and from his own report he apparently was attempting to decide whether he should join the Methodists , the Presbyterians , or some other Christian sect . 	0
I ' m sorry , I ' m not following you at all . 	0
I ' m off to bed so I won ' t be able to respond any time soon to further questions , but I do think we need to focus on content , not on personalities . 	0
Besides , Wikipedia is not about " sharing information " . 	0
It ' s not a social network . 	0
What I have opposed is the addition of details about how newspapers in the early 1830s were mocking Smith for having claimed to have seen God . 	0
That ' s unneeded detail , and I thought it was what we were talking about all along . 	0
Where did I say the detail of who Smith saw are too specific ? 	0
I ' ve never disputed that . 	1
So far I ' ve only seen one legitmate source that argues that the band isn ' t nu metal on this page , when I and Rockgenre have provided several that say that they are , one of which is one of the major sources used for this article . 	0
The article should mention that Smith said he saw God and Jesus and that seems to me to be appropriate . 	0
The phrasing of the source Rockgenre provided isn ' t really clear either way , although from the context the author seems to be arguing that System of a Down is an atypical nu metal band , not that they aren ' t nu metal . 	0
If anything , there seems to be consensus against this . 	0
I see no such thing . 	0

In particular Promethea is a tremendous work by a man who has won several writing awards , who has had many works turned into blockbuster movies , and is certainly one of the most significant writers in the world today . 	0

Promethea is an important work on magick that contains much about Crowley and Thelema , and most certainly SHOULD be mentioned in any section like this . 	1

He originally wrote " Zionist entity " in the wikilink but now writes " Zionist regime " and lets the disambiguation take the reader to Zionist entity which I find suspect . 	0

There is no need to include a specific band just because one source ( MTV , a commercial source , whose purpose is to increase album sales ) includes this band , when dozens of sources discredit the application of this term , and when the article for the term uses musical phrases that have nothing to do with the style of music that this band actually performs . 	1

Could you please provide a source for that claim ? 	0
My data seem to disagree with that - see , for example , here , page 77 - Gaza is ranked 36th , and that ' s counting the Gaza city area , not the entire strip , yielding a much higher density of 16 , 450 / km2 . 	1
Compared to other cities and urban areas around the world , there ' s nothing special about Gaza . 	1

There ' s no need to have an image from a controversial ongoing war that is likely to cause edit wars between people who want or don ' t want the image for one reason or another . 	0

The Citizens Commission on Human Rights fails as a RS for this matter , as it is a Scientology front group , IOW a pseudoskeptical group pushing pseudoscientific ideas . 	1
The very essence of what is involved in the proper understanding of pseudoscience and skepticism are being violated here . 	0
When pseudoscientists are considered " skeptical " , then we are in the land of pseudoskepticism . 	0
When believers in " pseudoscience " ( = fake science ) show " skepticism " of mainstream positions and science , they are often engaging in pseudoskepticism ( = fake skepticism ) . 	0
That ' s what is understood by the terms , and when Scientology and other fringe groups and individuals criticize mainstream positions , they can ' t be trusted , and should definitely not be used as sources here . 	1
That would be a total twisting of the idea behind this list . 	0
It must not become a " list of topics characterized as pseudoscience by pseudoskeptical groups and individuals " . 	0
That is not what the inclusion criteria specify , and since this is what ' s happening here , we need to strengthen the inclusion criteria so it doesn ' t happen again . 	0
That doesn ' t mean that even Scientology might not have some legitimate criticims , but ( 1 ) they just can ' t be trusted on this matter , and ( 2 ) they don ' t qualify as a source according to our inclusion criteria . 	0
If they have any legitimate criticisms , then it should be possible to find them in mainstream sources , not fringe sources . 	0
Clear case of fuzzyness and of little value to this article . 	0
That isnt fair or accurate . 	1
It is not " so many " governments that consider Hamas a terrorist organization , in fact many , many more do not consider it a terrorist organization . 	0
There is also much more on this page dealing with violent activities compared to their social programs . 	0
For as many users who want to portray Hamas in a " good light " there are many more users who want to try and portray them in a " bad light " , and too few who just want to say who they are and what they do and not put their own spin on it . 	0
I see no grounds for arguing against this view unless one has poor command of the English language ( or is a creationist ) . 	0
I am one of many editors - not just Roland - who believe that this article must distinguish clearly between evolution as fact ( e . g . measurable changes in the the descendents of hawthorne flies ) versus evolution as theory ( a set of concepts for understanding how and why these changes are occuring , and why they are important ) . 	0
Yes , facts are constituted through scientific consensus ( see Latour and Woolgar ´ s superb ethnography , Laboratory Life ) . 	0
The reason for this apparent dispute is that Slicky is not using English very precisely . 	1
Moreover , Slicky muddied the waters by naming General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics as facts . 	0
But this is an inadequate ( necessary but insufficient ) definition of " fact " as it is true of paradigms as well . 	0
They are theories or paradigms which themselves depend on certain facts . 	0
they are not . 	0
That both depend on scientific consensus does not make them the same , it only means they have ( at least ) one point of congruity . 	0
Roland was quite right to point out that facts and theories are different . 	0

Simply put , the claim , by Montaignier , is that it is possible to get rid of the infection with a good immune system , and this , made by someone of the stature of Montaignier , deserves a mention , perhaps in the treatment section . 	0
Whether his conclusions are correct or not , or shared by anyone else , needs to be contextualised , but claims such as these by Montagnier need to appear in the article . 	1
It can be contextualised , countered by others , etc , but it must be mentioned . 	0
Articles such as these often suffer from the conflict between , broadly , science and the humanities . 	1
Whether he ' s going off the deep end or not in our opinion is not important , what ' s important is a good article that fully and accurately covers and the topic . 	0
Montagnier is indisputably a reliable source himself , as one who is " generally regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand " . 	0

The actual article was originally written by a member of Ars Quattuor Coronati , which is a Masonic Research Lodge which meets in England under the auspices of the United Grand Lodge of England ! 	0
The statement - " the regularity of his initiations had been disputed " - is a pure fact , and get this : Crowley himself admitted that people disputed his Masonic regularity in his book " Confessions . " 	0

The UK is a sovereign state , which governs part of the island of Ireland , the EU is not a sovereign state , nor does it govern part of the island of Ireland , that ' s why the UK ' s flag is important and the EU ' s flag is not . 	1
User : MusicInTheHouse you stated the flag makes no benefit to the article . 	0

Secondly , you stated the flag isn ' t mentioned in the section . 	0
In what way does the Irish Tri-Colour make any benefit to the article any more than the UK flag would ? 	0

The question , as stated above , is not whether it ' s relevant to the IDF , but whether it is undue weight and recentism . 	0
The phrase as it has been preserved in recent edits reads : " The Roman Catholic Church , often referred to as the Catholic Church . . . " 	0
This is always going to be a bone of contention , and it will produce constant " edit wars " for as long as the present construction is stuck to . 	0
Multiple editors have altered it , mainly because the current format is considered misleading by many Catholics . 	0
A second point is the first sentence of the article . 	0
I would suggest something like : " The Roman Catholic Church , more officially termed the Catholic Church … " 	1
Assuming that the article title remains Roman Catholic Church , the first sentence still needs changing in order to be less misleading , and even offensive to some Catholics . 	1
The problem here is that what has become the current construction implies ( wrongly ) that the official name of the Church is the Roman Catholic Church , and Catholic Church is an unofficial term . 	0
The most recent edit has put : " The Catholic Church , often referred to by protestants as the Roman Catholic Church . . . " 	0

If you want paragraphs about Sabbath at the beginning of an article , go to the Black Sabbath article . 	0
This article is about heavy metal in general , and saying Sabbath is more important than Zeppelin and Deep Purple is utterly unverifiable . 	0
What ' s more , anyone could easily shoot that argument down by pointing out that Zeppelin was doing it before Sabbath , and had even more commercial success . 	0

After all , " size isn ' t everything , " and many gatherings are considerably smaller affairs than the March for Life or March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
I don ' t think that the relevancy of an issue can be judged from the apparent turnout in a picture of an isolated protest . 	1
Another user above expressed the concern that the younger age of the pro-life demonstrators in the photo makes the pro-choice cause appear less current . 	0
I think the issue is one of scale : the pro-life demonstration is by Bound for Life , a grassroots organization , while the pro-choice image depicts activists at the March for Women ' s Lives . 	0
Saying he " dictated " the Book of Mormon is a fairly neutral representation of what Smith did , and it takes no position on whether he was " translating " in a scientific sense , receiving text by revelation , or making it up as he went , all 3 of which are theoretically possible . 	1
Highlighting one of those options or opinions , that it was " translated by the gift and power of God " , is not that important in the context of the sentence as a whole . 	0
That claim can be and is covered elsewhere . 	0
Plus it ' s just more wordy and doesn ' t flow as well as the original text . 	0

If something needs to be sacrificed at the Good Article altar , my suggestion is that we reduce the epidemiological information ( much of paragraph 3 ) to about a sentence , and combine it with paragraph 4 . 	1
Specifically , those who assert that it is too long should state what information there is superfluous or in some way detracts from the goal of the lede being a readable overview . 	0
Therefore any criticism of its length should be based on content rather than an arbitrary number . 	0
What the lede needs to be is a concise , readable overview of the article . 	0

The soft parts can be compared to the soft parts of an Opeth or Tool song ( both bands two prominent prog metal bands , heavily influenced by Sabbath and especially this album with its innovative heavy / soft approach ) , which , also , hold no blues influences . 	0

The softer parts are soft ; neither the chord progressions , the song melodies , the guitar licks , or anything , contain any clear blues influences . 	0

I think it is important for the article to state this percentage to put the scandal in perspective . 	0
The students were extremely surprised and relieved to know this fact . 	0
If we are to mention the sex scandals in the lead , my suggestion would be to also include a percentage of total priests accused . 	0
It is very unfair to all of the faithful , hardworking and self-sacrificing priests out there who are suffering from this misconception and my heart really hurts for them . 	0
The church response and reforms were not covered by the press hardly at all and I think the aricle serves the public interest by making that known . 	0
Reasons why I think sex scandals should be mentioned in the lead : I think the article ' s section covering the sex abuse scandal is one of the most important ones because of the recent controversy and press coverage over it . 	1
In the Archdiocese of Miami the number was 1% of all priests who had worked here since 1950 . 	0
In my religious education class , I asked the students what percentage of priests they thought had been accused of sexual misconduct and I got answers ranging from 30-50% . 	0
Catholics have been persecuted more often than they have persecuted - all of these events are notable and relevent to the history of the Church and have been mentioned and wikilinked in the article as such . 	0
This is not POV , this is following Wikipedia guidelines . 	0
We cant say that an article is POV just because many instances of persecutions of Catholics are mentioned in greater number than persecutions by Catholics . 	1
The facts of history bear out the fact that is how it is . 	0
We can ' t eliminate those facts from the article without violating FA rules that require us to make mention of notable events . 	0
Just as the Inquisitions are mentioned and the facts relating to the persecution of heretics is provided , so we have given equal treatment to all other persecutions relevant to the Catholic Church . 	0
I would like to elaborate further on how this article is NPOV . 	0
The facts regarding the persecutions of Catholics in England , Ireland and Wales are relevant facts that speak directly about the Catholic Church - how it was banned in those areas and people who resisted were dealt with in a particular way - persecutions . 	0
If the article was not referenced to the top sources required by Wikipedia we could argue this but no one has offered a view of Catholic history different than what we have provided on the current page - even though I have searched for one in my diligent efforts to satisfy Karanacs . 	0

Pope SIxtus condemned the Spanish Inquisitions procedures at this time , but was brow-beaten by Ferdinand into saying nothing more . 	0
It could imply thst everyone tsken in by the inquisition was killed . 	0
In fact the 3-4 , 000 figure is across the Spanish Empire , and over a period of 400 years . 	0
As Kamen said , most local district courts in Europe executed far more people than the entire Spanish Inquisition over the period 1520 - 1820 . 	0

If you wish to see proof of the extent of all parties " terrorism " actions / consequences , check the statistics section on this website . . . http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp … . 	0
Having this statement in the initial / leading description of the " Hamas " wiki page implies that Hamas is more deserving of this label / view than their opposition ( israel ) , as this is not the method used in writing the " israel " wiki page . 	0
In fact , if we want to define " terrorism activities " according to the Geneva Conventions , the government of israel is CLEARLY responsible for the majority of attacks / civilain deaths and injuries in the conflict , and there continued actions causing ( the majority of ) civilian casualties over the years is clear proof of THEIR vioaltion of Geneva Convention article 57 . 	0

@ " Okedem " I ' m sorry . . . . 	0

should be treated equally . 	0

The first sentence of this section sounds awkward ( ask an editor who is not involved with WP and has no axe to grind about HIV ) and seems to bend over backwards to deny that anyone with any kind of biological credentials could possibly believe anything is missing from the current theory . 	0

The Sea People are assumed to have had the most impact on the coasts . 	0
The current coastal people are genetically highly similar to their inland neighbors . 	0
This misses the point . 	0
In order to determine that a given population ' s genetic pool lacks a significant contribution from some other given population , one needs to know first what characterizes the genes of that other population - - in this case , the " Sea People . " 	0
This is what " Tomer " means by knowing who they were . 	0
As the genetic character of the Sea People cannot be be determined , screening definitively for it seems impossible . 	1
Therefore it is unlikely the coastal people interbred with any outsiders to a greater degree than the inland people did . 	0
While stronger , that still isn ' t a lock . 	1

" Legendary " and " historical " do not show that Santa is a fable , a myth . 	1
While we cannot ignore the historical underpinnings of the character , we cannot - with respect to those who believe wholeheartedly in the Flying Fat Man - escape that the wacky stories and abilities attributed to the fellow are beyond those of mortal men . 	0
Much like the aforementioned example of the Easter Bunny , Santa is a mythical character . 	1
However , the greater part of the character is fantastical , with enough powers and abilities to make Superman envious . 	0

In addition , whether or not the AAF is a reliable source is not the question--the issue is whether or a link to their website is a reliable source . 	0

Therefore , I think that mythological is the best we are going to get , when the clear alternative would be to scientifically dismiss the character as an indigestion-inspired hallucination ( " more gravy than grave to it " , to paraphrase Scrooge ) . 	0
As to citing the LDS website , such citations are generally only appropriate in order to document official LDS positions or perspectives . 	0
To show the " truth " of something , it is more problemmatic , and you would want to cite something that has been peer reviewed . 	0

In the days before the creation of Israel ( and the mass emigration of sephardic Jews from Islamic Arab countries to Israel ) it was not that unusual for a Sephardic Jewish woman to marry a Muslim man , and in fact , a Jewish ( or Christian ) woman would not be required to convert to Islam to marry a Muslim man under Islamic law ( though a Muslim woman many only marry a Muslim though she may marry a Muslim convert and a woman from another religion not considered a " people of the book " like Jews or Christians would have to convert before Islamic law will recognize the marriage ) . 	1
Given the other account , that his mother converted to Islam at 9 years old , it may not be clear if his mother was from the grandmother ' s first marriage to the Jewish man or from the second marriage to the sheikh . 	0
Apparently , according to the Israeli media , under Jewish halachic law , to be a Jew one must be born to a Jewish mother or convert to Judaism . 	1
You are reading " psychoanalysis should not be generally characterized as pseudoscience " , which is in the text you cited . 	0
If so , Gaddafi would meet the legal Islamic definition of being a Muslim , while also meeting the legal , Jewish , definition of being a Jew . 	1

Our argument is about what constitutes a notable controversy in a WP article on the Roman Catholic Church , and my position is that the sex abuse scandals don ' t make the cut because so many other controversies in the church are so much more notable . 	1
Given the 2000 year history of the church , and all the things associated with the church , I ' d say even a mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead is undue weight , based on prominence of placement . 	1
Note that undue weight can be given in several ways , including , but not limited to , depth of detail , quantity of text , prominence of placement , and juxtaposition of statements " ( emphasis added ) . 	0
If the lead needs to include a contemporary controversy ( and it is not clear to me that it does ) , I understand mentioning the the sex abuse scandal , although I think that it is much more significant to the Roman Catholic Church , and much more encyclopedia-worthy , to include the debates around the implementation of Summorum Pontificum . 	0

So if I personally were describing corrupt abominable people , I might use the word ' sect ' also . 	0
One thing to consider is that Joseph Smith declares that the dispensation that he proclaims is a restoration of the Truth , and for everyone else - - " all their creeds were an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt " . 	0
Either way , he said the word ' sect ' and so unless you have some clear evidence that it didn ' t mean sect , then it should say ' sect ' . 	1
We can assume he knows no distinction and just switches terms constantly , or we can assume he deliberately chooses the terms . 	0
So , Smith uses a lot of different terms back and forth . 	0
In the lines leading up to the passage where Smith describes his experience in the official Joseph Smith-History from LDS , Smith uses various words to describe religion and religious things . 	0
In my view , changing from ' sect ' to ' church ' is a POV push . 	0

I happened by a statement that uses the phrase remained under British sovereignty in the context of NI . 	0
This is in the Judgment of the Court of Human Rights in the " Lawless v Ireland " case in 1961 which states on page 4 of the judgment in the " As to the Facts " section : " Under the Treaty establishing the Irish Free State , signed on 6th December 1921 between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State , six counties in the North of the Island of Ireland remained under British sovereignty . " 	0
Considering that the case was defended by the then Attorney General of Ireland Aindrias Ó Caoimh one could reasonably expect the facts to be as viewed by the state itself . 	1
Perhaps using that phrase would be preferable to any UK word use and you even have a decent reference to substantiate it and those are lawyers speaking . 	1
I think it ' s important to recognize though that this is an area where potentially we might have compromised and - and arrived at a bill that dealt with the narrow concerns about how a - a previable fetus or child was treated by a hospital . 	0
I recognize this is a passionate issue , and so I - I won ' t , as I said , belabor the point . 	0
And if we ' re placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as - as is necessary to try to keep that child alive , then we ' re probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality . 	0
Viability is the line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court to determine whether or not an abortion can or cannot take place . 	0
The second reason that it would probably be found unconstitutional is that this essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a previable child , or fetus , however way you want to describe it . 	0
For that purpose , I think it would probably be found unconstitutional . 	0
It was . 	0
I suggested to Members of the Judiciary Committee that it was unconstitutional and it would be struck down by the Seventh Circuit . 	0
I recall the last time we had a debate about abortion , we passed a bill out of here . 	0
Now , as I said before , this probably won ' t make any difference . 	0
Tenacious misunderstandings are quite a bit more of a problem . 	0
Contentious misunderstandings — say , using an editorial argument ( and its alleged abandonment ) as a platform to criticize a page or the project as a whole , and in doing so using it as a kicking-off place for several other misunderstandings — is a different , though at this page no less common , problem . 	0

On a side note , I see there is a small incomplete chart of Israel military casualties here , I would like to see a full article devoted to Israel ' s casualties like this one : United States casualties of war . 	0
Countries with much more " colorful " military history such as the United States armed forces , French Armed Forces , British Armed Forces , and Indian Armed Forces have no similar controversy section . 	0
For starters , it looks very misplaced . 	0
However I must take issue with the controversy controversy section . 	0
I ' ve been reviewing the article and for the most part it ' s pretty solid . 	0
To be perfectly honest I think those 3 articles could be easily moved into a single article , and any left pertinent information could be moved here . 	0
I propose we move the controversy section to Military history of Israel , History of the Israel Defense Forces , or Israeli wars and armed conflict . 	0

I don ' t feel that reggae should be listed before pop as the latter is more prevalent in the artist ' s music . 	1
Starting this discussion because a user was not happy with the genres being listed as " R&B , pop , reggae " instead of " R&B , reggae , pop " and an edit war over such an arrangement would be silly . 	0
R&B and pop have been the artist ' s main genres since her second album and influences were also present on her first . 	0
Reggae was prevalent on the artist ' s first album and partially on her second ; from 2008 to present , only influences have been present . 	0
How do other editors feel about this proposal ? 	0

Yes , because they are very-well known and have sold many albums ; but more importantly because the bulk of their music itself is in majority straight in line with heavy metal music tradition . 	0

I can place a bet that any book about heavy metal history that ' s worth its money mentions Judas Priest somewhere in there . 	1
Many early Rock n Rollers were influenced by delta blues artist Robert Johnson ; that doesn ' t make Johnson ' s music become Rock n Roll . 	0
Indeed Judas Priest are very highly rated , that ' s probably why they need to be monetioned in the lead , right ? . 	0
Agreed , we can ' t generalise Queen as heavy metal when they made a handful of songs vaguely related to the genre . 	1
More often than not they made rock songs , progressive rock , pop influenced four-part vocal showcases , broadway style piano pieces etc . Second , the number of Metal bands being influenced by Queen ' s music doesn ' t make them Metal either , its misunderstanding the statement . 	1

Mk5384 , you have expressed your justification for the comma , and others have explained the context in which a comma would be appropriate and the grammatical reason for why a comma where you have suggested one would require a second comma . 	0
The and was still required despite your addition of the comma , which should tell you that is not the basis for insertion . 	0
If you don ' t accept grammar as the basis upon which to justify the use of punctuation , we could address the logic of your explanation , as by saying , " At such eventual time as he is succeeded as POTUS the ' and current ' qualifier will no longer be in the article . 	0
The question of whether we add one comma is a matter of erroneousness . 	1
Your orange stems from the use of a single comma as substitute for the word and between two adjectives , as in changing " he is a tall and thin man " to " he is a tall , thin man " . 	0

Okay , we can clean up a few things . 	0
One way or another we need to keep this section manageable , and the most obvious solution is to chop off stuff of tangential relevance . 	0
The editors here seem to have agreed to include a brief mention of the event , but not to give a blow-by-blow account of what happened , when , whose fault it was , and what all of the players - something that will likely never be relevant here because this is an article about the life and times of Barack Obama , not BP and its tribulations . 	0

So to recap , it seems like you need to explain how you ' re not running against WP : EL # ADV and WP : ELNO ' s # 4 , 10 , and 11 ; if you can ' t get any editors who regularly use Wikipedia to comment in your favour here , perhaps you should seek redress via Wikipedia : Third opinion as your last resort in getting this put to bed . 	0

Indeed , I could complain about some parts of the article as it is , The section on the Reformation contains some highly critical comments : The most famous scholar of the age , Erasmus , in 1509 wrote In Praise of Folly which captured a widely held opinion about corruption in the church . [ 189 ] Abuses of power , usury , clerical wealth and hypocrisy all contributed to a general feeling among educated people that reform of some sort was necessary . [ 189 ] In 1517 , Martin Luther included his Ninety-Five Theses in a letter to several bishops , hoping to spark debate . [ 190 ] His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences . [ 190 ] Huldrych Zwingli , John Calvin , and others further criticized Catholic teachings . 	1
These challenges developed into the Protestant Reformation . 	0
I could object to some of this , Martin Luther inttended to spark more than debate when he posted his theses . 	0
and there are none of the many negatives about him here ( anti-semitism , allowing bigamy , coercion , sanctining slaying of the peasants ) . 	0
Martin gets off very lightly . 	0

In regards to the back and forth here , I think the reasons for hesitation on inclusions of these types of things are legit , and Scjessey ' s response ( while it does look POVish ) is based on the fact that there were editors here wanting to included everything negative pushed at Obama during the first months of his presidency . 	1

Perhaps something from earlier history - even very ancient history , would be more appropriate , avoiding the problems of politics , over-attention to recent history ( there are three images related to recent wars involving America , any more than one is too many ) and preferably not so gruesome . 	0
The image we had before , and I reverted the addition of this image once already , was Peter Fechter dying on the Berlin Wall , though that ' s from a period after the war had ended , so I ' d rather not use that as the ' final ' image for the section . 	1
Would an image of a US marine shot dead in Iraq be considered equally appropriate for the article ? 	0
Also think about this from a political view - Chinese people may be highly offended by the image . 	0
It seems a little over the top - Wikipedia is not censored , but do we need to use such a gruesome image to prove a point ? 	0
I tend to agree that this image is fairly disturbing - the body is partly decapitated and there are flies all over the head and torso . 	1
While I understand the incident is being investigated , it is hard to believe that not even a small blurb about a pending domestic abuse incident involving Rihanna is not included in this article . 	0

I might as well address this point now : as I had said above the pictures of abortion are pretty NPOV to begin with . 	0

As was said above I realize this is already a touched upon issue and my comment is nothing new to the argument but I was wondering why is there no actual picture of an abortion / post aborted fetus on this page ? 	0

That said , I still fail to see what you ' re positing as the source of diversity . 	0
Let ' s assume we mean ' speciation ' when we talk about ' diversity ' . 	0
Anyway , that ' s obviously a semantic argument that ' s not worth having . 	0
Drift and selection in that context act AGAINST the existing diversity , produced by mutations , and can only result in eventual fixation - that is , the elimination of variation . 	0
If you just mean ' variation ' , e . g . the diversity evident within the human population , then you are wrong . 	1
Also , I ' m unclear on how you ' re using ' diversity ' - if you mean strictly speciation , then I ' ll agree that drift and selection are important forces that are required to produce speciation , since one couldn ' t have fixation / divergence without them by definition . 	1

Mostly my sense of bemused irritation comes from folks who want to portray all natural , surgical , and pharmaceutical procedures similarly . 	0
I can agree with that ( while also noting that the most widely used form of induced fertilized egg / blastocyst / fetus rejections are pharmaceutical , not surgical , in nature ) , but could that mean that the article is lopsided , or how we use pictures in the article is lopsided , or what ? 	0

While seeing such things doesn ' t really bother me all that much ( having fed a good 20-30 fetuses to coyotes in my life , and consuming at least a few hundred . . . life on a farm an all ) , I ' m divided on how to present the subject , images , and article , properly in a NPOV manner . 	0
However , I can understand their motivations , in that they are wishing to " humanize " and " personalize " , abortion , and one of the more functional tactics in that effort has been using shock images . 	0
To repeat a refrain , many who have asked for ( and suggested ) pictures are * not * asking for pictures of an abortion procedure , or process , they are asking for gore pictures of a dead human fetus , which is not what this article is about , subject-wise ( Though it could be , if the article was renamed Human aborted fetuses ) . 	0

" Number one , whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the Constitution , what we ' re really saying is , in fact , that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a - a child , a nine-month-old - - child that was delivered to term . 	0
Unfortunately , this bill goes a little bit further , and so I just want to suggest , not that I think it ' ll make too much difference with respect to how we vote , that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny . " 	0
And there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion . 	0
" Well , it turned out - that during the testimony a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman ' s right to choose an abortion were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns that your - you raised and that were raised by witnesses in the testimony . 	0
Is that correct ? " 	0
And one of the concerns that came out in the testimony was the fact that they were not being properly cared for during that brief period of time that they were still living . 	0
According to the IL Senate transcripts , which links I just included , Obama ' s reasons for opposing the bills can be seen as follows , from his words posted verbatim : " Senator O ' Malley , the testimony during the committee indicated that one of the key concerns was - is that there was a method of abortion , an induced abortion , where the - - the fetus or child , as - as some might describe it , is still temporarily alive outside the womb . 	0
As for # 1 , if you mean Obama was opposing the bills on state ' s rights , then you ' re wrong , and I ' m not sure where you are getting your sources . 	1
I mean , it - it would essentially bar abortions , because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child , then this would be an antiabortion statute . 	0
That determination then , essentially , if it was accepted by a court , would forbid abortions to take place . 	0

RG , you state certainties , except when you say that Zeppelin are without a doubt a metal band . 	1
They have one foot in the hard rock genre , and the other in the blues genre , together with the influences you mention , and I would hesitantly include heavy metal among those influences , because none of their albums are actual heavy metal ; they don ' t have it as an overhanging concept , but they do have heavy metal-ish ( I ' d say hard rock ) songs in their albums , like " Whole Lotta Love " and " Immigrant Song " . 	0

I disagree that " Personal life sections tend to give WP : UNDUEWEIGHT to information which distracts the reader from the indivdual ' s WP : NOTABILITY . " 	0
While no one , except mostly reality show stars , become famous / notable for their personal lives , I do not believe that it ' s trivial in the scope of their career and should not be the focus of an encyclopedia . 	1
But , really , I do not see the Personal life sections as that different than the Early life sections , except for the fact that the Early life sections deal with a person ' s early personal life . . . while the other deals with the person ' s later personal life . 	0
I also point out that the Chris Brown article handles its section about " the incident " pretty well and it seems to be enough information there for it to have its own section . 	0
The same goes for Michael Jackson . 	0

Hello Skoblentz , since the topic is " First Lady " , I prefer to discuss it here . 	0
On medical issues , we as Wikipedia editors should not support statements with anecdotes or personal analysis of the issues , however logical or sensible they may seem . 	0

To use entity is very POV . 	1
You want to use " wiped of the map " because that was how Ahmadinejad ' s own people translated it yet you seem to be rejecting the same standard for " Zionist regime " . 	0
Regime does not carry the same pejorative meaning and means a government not a state ( it is clear from any translation that Ahmadinejad meant government ) so clearly they can not be interchangeable . 	1
Firstly , the wiki page says using entity is " a pejorative for the State of Israel " . 	0
A search finds 63 , 000 results for entity being used in a translation of the speech ( mostly op-eds and blogs with a few conservative newspapers ) and 357 , 000 results for " Zionist Regime " being used in a translation of the speech ( a large number of mainstream media including Haaretz , CNN , Washington Post , NYT and BBC etc ) . 	0
Secondly , entity is not even close to the most widespread translation and the first time I have ever heard the word entity used for Israel was this article . 	0
The reliable sources noticeboard has already agreed that the quotes should be in the article . 	0

It apposes the sexual act between somebody of the same sex but also says . . . 2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible . 	0
Also on the topic of homosexuality , this is the official , from the Catechism stance of the Church . 	0
They must be accepted with respect , compassion , and sensitivity . 	0
They do not choose their homosexual condition ; for most of them it is a trial . 	0
These persons are called to fulfill God ' s will in their lives and , if they are Christians , to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord ' s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition . 	0
Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided . 	1
Of course they take their view of Catholicism from a sensationalistic press rather than going to the source which says a homosexual must be treated with respect , compassion and sensitivity , also unjust disrcimination against them is wrong . 	0
If the athiests who keep coming to rewrite the article with POV don ' t actually read things like the Catechism then we can never hope for a real NPOV . 	0

For example , Wikipedia mentions notable criticisms of Barack Obama , but none are mentioned on the main page because of how strongly the editors there fight it . 	0
I would think consensus alone should not be enough to block mention of topics that are notable and reliably sourced . 	0
I have found in the past that no matter how notable a criticism of Obama , or how well-sourced it may be , that the editors on the Obama page will fight it tooth and nail , bringing in other liberal editors from elsewhere on Wikipedia and then claiming ' consensus ' regardless of past editors who provided opposite consensus who just aren ' t present at the time . 	1

As to confusing , while BP is , as you say , the operator of the well , Transocean is the operator of the rig and Transocean is the driller of the well ; it technically isn ' t an operating well until the drilling rig sails off and a production rig comes in . 	0
BP is the client , but Transocean is the captain of the ship ( rig / platform ) . 	0
The Macondo Prospect isn ' t a well , it ' s an oil field . 	0
What blew up was something drilled for the prior couple months by Transocean ( allegedly faultily , with pieces of their BOP annulus breaking and coming up the riser pipe in chunks , indicating it was not in a condition to prevent a blowout ) and the casing sealed early that morning by Halliburton ( allegedly shoddily ; cementing problems are associated with 18 of 39 blowouts in the previous 15 years ; Halliburton admitted faulty cementing before the Montara oil spill in Australia last year ) . 	0
The Deepwater Horizon is a drilling rig , known at Wikipedia as an oil platform . 	0
It isn ' t BP ' s rig / platform , it is Transocean ' s rig / platform . 	0
For someone complaining about piping links , you don ' t check them . 	1
There is no Wikipedia article called oil rig . 	0
And , while BP was 65% owner of the field , and so of the oil gushing from that field , the hearings that have been held have raked Transocean and Halliburton over the coals , and the investigations are looking into their actions , inactions and histories as much as BP ' s . 	0

Why don ' t you just let the facts be told , and let people make up their own minds as to what conclusions to make . 	0
If your answer is no , then please do not hinder me ( or anyone else ) from contributing legitimate facts of truth to balance the obvious bias that is trying to be imposed on a legally elected governing body in order to shift readers to a specific viewpoint . 	0
if your answer is yes , I await your edit to the page ( as I see you have done much editing to it , and will leave it to you ) and will not argue about having this information described in the first paragraph of the " Hamas " page . 	0
For example , would you agree that in the first paragraph of the " israel " wiki page , it would state that the majority of the Palestinian population and millions of other people around the world regard israel as one of the biggest terrorist states ? ? 	0
No one here is opposing the idea of including the ( false ) labels that people want to attribute to Hamas , we are just asking for the same treatment as is given to other governing bodies on wikipedia . 	1
Before they were elected , maybe it would have seemed logical to include this type of view in the first paragraph , but not now , since the main subject surrounding the group ( for the people it represents i . e . the Palestinians ) pertains to it ' s legal standing as a minority government . 	0
Thank you for moving my comment . . . . . as for the discussion , if you agree that the wiki page for " United States " should state in the first paragraph that it is considered by millions of people around the world as the biggest terrorist state , then I see no problem in doing this with Hamas ' wiki page . 	0

The definition of holocaust denial ( according to wikipedia ) is : " Holocaust denial consists of claims that the genocide of Jews during World War II — usually referred to as the Holocaust [ 1 ] — did not occur at all , or that it did not happen in the manner or to the extent historically recognized . " no " claims " are being made , so it cannot be classified as a holocaust denial , especially given that he specifically addressed that in numerous occasions to clear that he is NOT denying the holocaust . 	0
You offer part of Europe and we will support it . " this is called : " Expressing doubt " & " Questioning " - not " denying " - as it is well described in the news item from wikinews This is especially clear when it follows a remark about the special laws prohibiting to question the holocaust in europe . 	0

Meanwhile please note that 1921 is given as the date of partition in the article Northern Ireland . 	0
If you want to claim that they were purely " administrative " ( a term which normally implies that there is no elected political control ) , please provide references . 	0
In fact the two entities created under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had both their own judicial system and parliaments with legislative powers , neither of which are charcteristics of an administrative subdivision . 	0
O Fenian ' s argument against 1921 as the date of partition seems to be that it was the creation of " administrative subdivisions " , which is the sort of term normally used for local councils or government regions created for administrative purposes under one political authority . 	0

Only controversies that affected the IDF in a significant way should be represented ; this excludes things like ( looking at the current section ) : the USS Liberty incident , the term " IOF " , Oranim College , the offensive t-shirts , etc .

A brief scan through parts of the article reveals some dubious points : In 1521 , the first Catholics were baptized in what would become the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia , the Philippines . [ 171 ] The following year , Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico , although they did not begin large-scale baptisms until 1537 , when Pope Paul III determined that the indigenous peoples did have souls . [ 174 ] Over the next 150 years , the missions expanded into southwestern North America . [ 175 ] The native people were legally defined as children , and the priests took on a paternalistic role , often enforced with corporal punishment . [ 176 ] In India , Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among a Christian community which had been established by Thomas the Apostle . [ 177 ] I find a lot of this information very dubious . 	1
Huge numbers were converted in Mexico before 1537 , and I don ' t think there was much serious debate over whether Indians had souls . 	0
WHO legally defined native people as children , Church , Governments ? 	0

In the thread above , I asked two questions which I still feel will serve as a basis to guide this conversation . 	0
Remember , this is not a list of definitive pseudosciences , but rather a list of characterizations . 	0
This perpetrates the inherent bias of this article ' s inclusion criteria which allows for characterizations made by certain notable organizations and people , but disallows characterizations made by other organizations and people just as notable . 	0
Because some editors feel that these organizations and researchers are in themselves pseuodskeptical and / or pseudoscientific , thus they are ill-equipped to label something a pseudoscience and therefore their views on what they characterize to be a pseudoscience should not be included in this list . 	0
Why ? 	0
Recent attempts to include significant views of certain notable organizations , notable academics and notable researchers have been summarily eliminated and denied from this article . 	0
So , why are we including the characterizations made by these researchers and organizations , but excluding - and moreover disallowing - the characterizations made by other researchers and organizations . 	0
While per WP : PSCI only a general consensus in the scientific community can truly label a topic as pseudoscience , this article includes entries of topics which have only been characterized as a pseudoscience by one researcher or by one skeptical organization and not the general scientific community . 	0

The bottom line is that the implications within the two pictures are far too obvious . 	0
The fact is that plenty of distasteful picketing occurs on both sides ( see http://img.timeinc.net/time/daily/2003/0301/protest0121.jpg ) and that silent and subdued protests are far and few between when it comes to topics this fervently debated . 	1
Specifically , the fact that the pro-life protest is shown as modest and subdued whereas the pro-choice protest is depicted as obnoxious and fervent . 	0
While the details are not really that relevant ( the fact that one picture contains attractive people in their mid-20 ' s and the other is a badly compressed image of 30-40 year-olds ) the subjects ' activities are . 	0
Its also worth pointing out that the rally picture is of a much lower quality . 	1
The one displaying pro-life supporters shows young men and women holding a silent vigil , whereas the pro-choice representation shows older people rallying and picketing obnoxiously . 	0
I think the two pictures displayed alongside the " Abortion Debate " headline within the article are a bit ridiculous . 	1

What Ibaranoff needs to provide is a reliable source ( or several ) that explain why System of a Down shouldn ' t be classified as nu metal ; providing sources that simply don ' t say the words " nu metal " isn ' t the same thing . 	1

Now , as for sources . 	0
Aside from that , many of the sources Ibaranoff points to at Talk : System of a Down are album / live reviews . 	0
Furthermore , one of the primary metal histories used a source for the article , Ian Christe ' s Sound of the Beast , describes them as nu metal as well , in a chapter largely devoted to nu metal ( I just double checked the book this instant ) . 	0

As you are no doubt well aware , Wikipedia is not censored . 	0
The version you substituted left the word completely unmentioned , which does * not * aid understanding and accessibility . 	1
In fact it reduces it , because the reader can only be left in confusion wondering what the vulgar word might have been . 	1

I support the more correct wording even if it appears to others to be pro-Catholic ( which I dont think it does - facts are facts and we just want to tell the truth ) If we eliminate current wording in favor of Karanacs proposal , we lose several important wikilinks too . 	0

Secondly , you will note that the Dede Maroz , Christkind or other names for Santa / Father Christmas aren ' t as widely read as this , one of the three main articles on the subject ( the other two being Father Christmas and Saint Nicholas ) , and certainly they aren ' t anywhere near the quality of this one ; they aren ' t a valid comparison . 	1

( ec ) xandar , You are correct . 	0
My position is that you started the edit war by removing a very central piece of information that had been in the article since 2006 as " utter irrelevance " , and persisting in reverting attempts to put it back by me and another person that just saw your removal as absurd ( I think claiming it ' s irrelevant is revisionism if anything ) . 	0
If you still feel it ' s wrong for it to be there , perhaps we should make a Request for Comment . 	0

I think that the page should have been renamed Catholic Church and the first sentence gone the other way around saying " The Catholic Church , also known as the Roman Catholic Church … " . 	1
I think this is evident from the title of the book " The Catechism of the Catholic Church " which is conspicuously not entitled " The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church " . 	0
The Roman Catholic Church is the only one that officially calls itself the Catholic Church . 	0
Xandar is correct . 	1
Not only is HIV less than a century young , but HIV ' s relatives in primate species are all similarly recent in origin . 	0

A peer reviewer has made two suggestions for improvement to the article that would be significant changes . 	0
Roman Catholic Church is part of Christianity and it would be inconsistent to make the comparison here , it would also be off topic for the subject matter of the page . 	0
What you should do is make that kind of comparison on the Christianity article since you are comparing a whole faith to a whole faith - the number of Christians to the number of Muslims . 	1
It seems like comparing apples to oranges to put any comment about Muslims outnumbering Roman Catholics . 	0
This is more than mere History , it has to do with the present day and the two issues of Origin and Mission go together , they are entertwined with each other and extend beyond the concept of History with regards to the church ' s activities in the world today . 	0
Also , eliminating the Nicene Creed will not help the reader who wants to know what the Catholic Church believes . 	1
It would relegate the most important part of Roman Catholic Belief to a mere wikilink which I think makes an improper statement and moves the wikilinked page of Nicene Creed out of control of the Roman Catholic page . 	0
Currently , I dont think the Nicene Creed page is a very good page and if our page eventually becomes FA , that would help the reader have confidence in what he or she is reading on the RCC page which should include the short Nicene Creed quote . 	0
Please add your comments and opinions to mine here on the talk page so we can come to consensus on these issues . 	0

We are only a couple of weeks away from resubmitting this article for FA and the vandalism is really an obstacle here . 	0

The genre is not prevalent enough in Rihanna ' s music I would say , and the influences of it that are present in her music are covered by contemporary R&B which is already listed . 	0

How can you claim that the UN report is a joke when we all saw with our own eyes the IDF bombing UNRWA schools with white phosphorus ? 	0

The whole idea of a " First Lady " is a sexist one that assumes that a wife ' s only duty is to serve her husband , and be a hostess . 	0
The terms may sound silly , pompous , and old fashioned , but if that is an argument againt them , it is also an argument against both the names , but even more so the position and functions , of the " First Lady " and " First Gentleman " . 	0
The titles mentioned of " First Master " and " First Lord " are in fact technically more accurate terms than " First Gentleman " , it ' s just that journalist and commentators seem to think that Gentleman is the equivalent of Lady in this context which , if you are pedantic , it isn ' t . 	0
Yet present wording does mention the major events and provides wikilinks that Karanacs version would eliminate . 	0
Responding to Karanacs : The present article wording does not mention justification of either Mary or Elizabeth ' s actions - it treats them equally - NPOV . 	0
No offense , it is just my honest opinion . 	0
I think present wording is more valuable and factually accurate that what Karanacs has proposed . 	1
I am more interested in providing those facts and I dont think they make the article POV one way or the other . 	0
If I was a kid doing research , I am more helped by present wording with appropriate wikilinks . 	0
Interesting interpretations of the Anglo-Irish treaty aside , the Free State never had control over Northern Ireland . 	0
Southern Irish troops ( we didn ' t have tanks ) didn ' t march in one day and out the next . 	0
At the time there was no disagreement that Great Britain ( with or without Northern Ireland ) was to be the successor state of the UK of Great Britain and Ireland . 	0
Thus it is was the Free State that joined the League of Nations as an entirely new entity while the UK remained a member . 	0
As a matter of English there ' s no ambiguity in saying that Northern Ireland remained in the UK . 	0
Legally speaking it ' s the rules of state succession that determine whether the 1923 UK was the same state as the 1920 UK . 	0
There was a time when states didn ' t have official names but managed to exist nonetheless . 	0
The Statement : " Belfast is a city in the United Kingdom " was as true in 1920 as it was in 1923 and as it is now . 	0

There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding regarding the role of the UGLE and the Grand Lodge of BC and Yukon , which I attempted to clear up with my various edits . 	0
The United Grand Lodge of England is not the " official body of Freemasonry " , as none exists , but it is considered the standard for Masonic recognition ( there are exceptions , but Crowley wouldn ' t fit into one of them . ) 	0
The Grand Loge de France violates Anderson ' s Constitutions by not requiring a belief in a Supreme Being ; as such , its regularity is not in question at all , but nonexistent . 	0
In addition , recognition is not disputed by the Canadian body ( as mentioned before , no such dispute is necessary ) ; that organization simply functions as a repository of responses , original and reposted , to common anti-Masonic allegations . 	1
Judas Priests contributions are not sourced either , so why should they have the right to be up there unsourced ? 	0

If it weren ' t for his most recent edit here , I would have held back from responding here for a day or two to see if Jzyehoshua was going to take my advice and fish out one issue from the several above to focus on calmly and patiently discussing a responsible edit for , but his going back over earlier edits to change them to red boldface text as is his first edit after my admonition suggests it ' s still more for him about attracting attention on and strewing and smearing this stuff throughout the talk and archive pages than it is about responsible and rationally presented editorial suggestions for the article . 	0

I would posit that much of the information contained in the Wikipedia article is sourced from the research and effort of the LAShTAL . com membership . 	0

Based on a review of the LAShTAL . com site and WP : ELNO , I agree with Acsociety ' s assessment that the Aleister Crowley article ahould reference the LAShTAL . com site . 	1
The LAShTAL . com resources are much more than collection links to existing work - they comprise the most accurate , scholarly analysis of the man and his works in any format . 	0
As such , it is the recognized comprehensive authority on the life and works of Crowley and the repository of much original work on the topic . 	0

Your reference to the Geneva conventions supports my point that adding " terrorist tactics " on the wiki pages of U .

A factual claim , right or wrong , is not criticism . 	0

That is the more serious proposal , covering people ' s negative opinions about Obama , and that is precisely what is discouraged on Wikipedia and has been rejected time after time . 	0
That is normally based in fact , although there is a different sense ( one wholly unsuitable here ) for baseless negative assertions - but even those are assertions of opinion . 	0
It would fit the Wikipedia concept of a coatrack . 	0
Others refer to criticism as negative opinions about the facts of a thing , the oppositve of praise . 	0
Responding to Jzyehoshua ' s point , you are referring to a different meaning of the word " criticism " . 	1
What you initially proposed is that we include negative facts about Obama for the sake of including negative facts , which is not criticism at all . 	0
And yes , I am disqualifying many of the accounts from which this was brought this up in the past - they are now banned as fake accounts , and the long-term editors here have been very wary of new accounts making similar proposals . 	0

Well , that ' s a useful criticism , thank you , JoeSmack . 	0
The new page could also address social ( young adults , thus orphans ) and political ( locations other than South Africa ) issues in more detail . 	0
In such case , my opinion is that the Denialism section could be excised entirely and moved to the new page instead of being an awkward part of the HIV page . 	0
Finally , if the issue really boils down to focusing more on the science ( which I generally support ) , perhaps yet another page could be created specifically about " HIV and AIDS Linkage " or some similar title . 	0

( edit conflict ) As noted in my edit summary , this article is about the life and career of Barack Obama . 	0
It is not an in-depth article about all of the policy decisions and the politics that go along with them . 	0
Even if the content were well-sourced , and of sufficient weight to include in the encyclopedia somewhere ( neither of which are the case ) , it is not pertinent to the subject of this article . 	0
Although the Washington Times is sometimes a reliable source for some content , it is problematic when it comes to politics due to the paper ' s strong conservative bent , lackluster respect for factual accuracy ( often mischaracterizing or printing unsubstantiated facts to support its position ) , and being very sloppy about distinguishing opinion and propaganda from factual reportage . 	1
This article is a case in point . 	0
It is masquerading as a news story , but it uses phrases like " back door " and conjecture like " the memo suggests that . . . " , amidst a highly selective choice of quotes , to hide what is partly an opinion and speculation piece . 	0
Regarding weight here or anywhere , the substance is that a second or third tier official approved a report written by four staffers ( or something like that ) proposing a form of immigration amnesty . 	0
There is nothing in the source that says it has anything to do with Obama , or is anywhere close to getting enacted . 	0

I don ' t see the rationale of including this information in this article . 	0
It also sounds like you are out to " prove " something is the case . 	1
The visits of the angel Moroni to Smith were emphasized by the early church much more than the First Vision , but the details of those visitations are not set out in this article — they are reserved for articles like Angel Moroni . 	0
To me it sounds like you are giving undue weight to the event which actually was not given a great amount of weight at the time . 	0
Also , you state that Smith ' s account is in the Pearl of Great Price and is considered scripture by adherents , but only the LDS Church has canonized the 1838 account — other Mormon fundamentalists don ' t necessarily view the account as scripture . 	0

I don ' t think that CCHR fails as an RS for this particular article . 	1
Sure it is a front for Scientology , but this list doesn ' t proclude such sources from being used . 	0
The bottomline is that CCHR is a notable psychiatry skeptic organization . 	0
And beyond that , those who are calling psychiatry a pseudoscience per the CCHR sources are each unto themselves notable academics and researchers ( Thomas Szasz for instance certainly passes the WP : N threshhold , as does Fred Baughman , Julian Whitaker , and Mary Ann Block , to cite a few ) . 	0
That CCHR is a " pseudoskeptical organization " is just a judgment of a Fyslee ( I tend to agree FWIW ) , but even if it was a judgment of another reliable source , that still doesn ' t disqualify the CCHR as a notable skeptical organization which has characterized something as pseudoscience . 	0
However , if this list article also recognizes significant points of view from notable organizations , researchers , and academic outside of the mainstream , then the list becomes compliant with NPOV . 	0
If we are going to limit the inclusionary criteria of this list article to just mainstream sources , then the entire list article will stand as a WP : NPOV violation and probably should be nominated for deletion as such . 	0

Nut advocates distorts historical perspective ; compared with other controversies , the sex abuse scandals are barely notable , and including it in the lead gives them far more than their due weight . 	0

So is the " undue weight " argument that that these allegations and countercharges among young Israeli soldiers , with serious repercussions throughout Israeli society , isn ' t as " heavy " as charges of phosphorus weapons use and can ' t appear beside it ? 	0
I felt the content is relevant in light of interest among the English-language readership ( some of whom are likely to view it as fuel for criticism of the IDF and Israel ; hence my unfortunate use here of the terms " atrocities and war crimes " that I trusted was certainly not to be read as any agenda of my own ! ) . 	0

Now to address your point Bleh - your argument regarding sexual images is moot ; there are of course such images at commons if people want to see them , just as there are plenty of gory images of dead people and such , but there is no photograph on sexual intercourse of two individuals at the height of copulation . 	0
Regarding pictures from long past wars , there obviously won ' t be anything in the form of a photograph , but there plenty of paintings etc . I had a very brief look for something suitable but there was nothing that especially caught my eye . 	0
There is already a picture from a 20th century war just below in the suicide attack section , as well as the image of American graves in the lead , so I believe it would be more balanced to include something from times long past , like artwork from a chariot battle for example . 	0
There is no need to show the most graphic or pornographic image just because one is available , and if an image is controversial for whatever reason there should be at least some rationale for keeping it . 	0

Even though I fail to see the meaning of that article , and how it contradicts this one , it is more accurate in its depict of the musical interrelations of the early bands , with emphasis on Black Sabbath . . 	0
but hey , that ' s the case with a few 100 , 000 articles here on this second hand source page . 	0
How do you know Black Sabbath ' s importance is false , a myth ? 	0
The comment about " over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation " strikes me as odd : not only unsupported by WP , but contradicting the scientific nature of this topic which has inspired very careful research for over two decades . 	1
The paragraph where Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , and Led Zeppelin are mentioned as pioneers of the genre is invalid ; it states that all three bands were reviled by critics . 	1
First off , Deep Purple met indifference in their start , which is not the same as being reviled , which their albums never were . 	0
With their success that followed in the U . S . , they were , however , acclaimed . 	0
Secondly , Led Zeppelin never met criticism like that of Black Sabbath ; Zeppelin were , instead , criticized for not being as good as , according to Rolling Stone in the review of their first album , like The Jeff Beck Group , and Robert Plant was compared condescendingly to Rod Stewart . 	0
Basically , not the same kind of criticism Black Sabbath got . 	0
Sabbath were persistently rejected until their fifth album ( I dislike referring to wikipedia articles , but this is backed by the articles for all their first five albums ) Sabbath Bloody Sabbath . 	0
The criticism was a direct result of their alien-sounding music , which clashed with the current , which was blues-inspired Hard rock , like Zeppelin , Purple , Iron Butterfly etc . To conclude , the introduction falters and misleads , and should be rewritten more accurately . 	0

This proves , beyond the possibility of argument , that Palestine IS a state , and therefore under U . S . law , cannot be included under the definition of " terrorism " . 	1
Since Hamas is now the legal , governing political party of the state / country of Palestine , they can no longer be considered as a " terrorist organization " ( under U . S . law ) . 	0

Things in the UK certainly haven ' t got to quite the level that they have in the States , with Dioceses going into bankruptcy , but I really don ' t think you can that there is no problem with how the issue has been dealt with . 	1
As I ' ve pointed out before , it has been enough of an issue in the UK that a previous Archbishop of Cardiff had to resign over his handling of abuse cases , and Cormac Murphy-O ' Connor also received pretty major coverage for his handling of a case when he was at Arundel ( less justifiably in that case certainly ) . 	0
Ireland has also had a serious problem with many claims coming from those who were at catholic schools . 	0

Thank you for the response , Wikidemon . 	0
It simply isn ' t balanced in my humble opinion . 	1
I see him and all of his policies made out to look fantastic here , and some of the entries make sure to point out how he ' s reversed Bush ' s policies , in a presumably positive way . 	0

It couldn ' t remain in something that ceased to exist ! 	0
I disagree with this , and feel that use of the term ( heavy metal ) throughout the ' 70s was largely consistent with modern standards , and much of the crossing of " hard rock " and " heavy metal " very probably arose from the fact that many hard rock bands of the time did a few metal songs . 	0
There are even exceptions to this ( particularly ZZ Top , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Foghat , and Meat Loaf ) . 	0
The tricolour certainly is not the flag of Ireland , de facto or otherwise , just as La Bandera de España isn ' t the flag of the Iberian Peninsula . 	1

I don ' t think the preceding ones are really deemed as classics . 	0

Lastly , you are vandalizing the article because you are inserting content against consensus ( or at least , without one ) , not to mention the little effort that was apparently put in to proper spelling and capitalization in the edits . 	1
We will need some mainstream sources that use , or discuss the use , of the IOF as an alternative name to IDF , not sources that accuse IDF of occupation , which is a completely different issue . 	0
In general , when trying to insert an alternative term for any article name , this needs to have some official or mainstream credibility , and the guidelines are more stringent than for representing two opposing viewpoints in the article ' s content . 	0
They refer to Israeli forces as occupiers , but do not use the term Israeli Occupation Forces ( notice the capitalization ) as an alternative to Israel Defense Forces ( you are trying to insert a passage into the article which says that the IDF is also called IOF by some , which is not supported by Sean Hoyland ' s articles , and is well-known to represent a fringe point of view — see WP : FRINGE ) . 	0

If there ' s any other improvement you care to propose , preferably one that doesn ' t involve some of the things other editors have objected to - - details on matters unrelated to Obama , substantial expansion of the section , or wikilinks that fall under the " easter egg " category described in the tutorial - - please feel free to propose them here or simply edit the article to improve it . 	0

I ' m starting a new thread to break away from the above discussion , which , for the most part , has turned from the subject . 	0
The controversy section should outline for what practices the IDF has been criticized and why ( with sources ) , not for what specific events , because it is possible to find multiple sources criticizing the IDF for its every single publicized operation at least starting with the First Lebanon War and onwards . 	0
Feel free to rewrite the section , but please try not to place undue weight on recent events ( Cast Lead , and even the 2006 Lebanon War attracted undue attention on Wikipedia in general , unlike for example the much bigger 1956 Sinai War ) . 	0
Now , I agree that the controversy section is severely lacking ( in quality , not length ) , and IMO one of the reasons is that this article does not have many dedicated editors . 	0
There is no reason to detail each incident , and certainly not in the context of soldiers ' coming out ' to ' reveal ' something about the IDF , as indeed there is an entire organization in Israel devoted to this very purpose , which is not mentioned even once in the article . 	0
Even if many notable organizations accuse the IDF of war crimes here , the article should take a more general approach , such as " The IDF was accused of war crimes for its actions in several operations , including Sabra and Shatila and Operation Cast Lead . [ ref ] " . 	0
Therefore , I fail to see how something like this would not be undue weight for the article . 	1
Firstly , I don ' t think it ' s our place to judge whether these actions amounted to war crimes , assuming the testaments are true and were reported correctly . 	0

I ' m removing this , because as previously discussed POZ is not a reliable source : " The dissidents assert that epidemiological cofactors are required , along with HIV , in order for a person to contract AIDS . 	0
There is presumption ( logical and statistically supported , but still presumption ) of HIV infection as the cause of their deaths . 	0
In addition , the fact that some HIV-positive people did not get AIDS after many years , as well as the fact that a cure or prevention has still not been discovered , supported the hypothesis that other conditions ( cofactors ) besides HIV infection might be necessary ; that is , AIDS may result from a combination of causes .

Well , here ' s why you should . 	0
You want to add material to the article , and thus the burden is on you to provide sources , and you have supplied some , but some editors are not happy with those sources , my guess is that the basic objection is that these sources are not as good as others available . 	1

I honestly don ' t understand why this is so controversial ; after all nobody gets in a huff about the United States of America ' s founding date being 1776 , when the history of the American people precedes that date by over a century . 	0
In fact , there was no country or state prior to 1910 with the structure and geographical area of the Union , which is why that date is universally regarded as the date on which South Africa as it exists today was " born " . 	0
I have read the links you provided , but they have revealed to me nothing beyond what I already know . 	0
I think this is a fairly important point , since it has an impact on the dates we include in this article . 	1
The ZAR was subsumed into the Union of South Africa in 1910 , it did not become the Union . 	0

More extensive description should , IMO , address issues such as the fact that most AIDS victims in Africa were never confirmed as HIV positive by testing . 	1
I have previously commented in Talk on the irrelevance of social issues such as orphans in the lead of an article about a virus ( which is NOT the same as the syndrome , which is a specific medical term distinct from disease ) . 	0
To me , this suggests that the HIV article needs " more extensive description " , including possible revision of the lead . 	1
The page on undue weight includes this : Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order to avoid misleading the reader . 	0
Thus , we see what is IMO a blatant POV term such as " denialism " instead of skepticism or " alternative explanations " in the section heading that gives lip service to other viewpoints . 	0
This also suggests that the preponderance of media repetition of known information about HIV and AIDS may create the impression that minority views are " tiny " ( a subjective term ) . 	1

The problem with setting down a figure like 3-4000 in isolation is that it has no context . 	1
Just like the headline figure of 4 , 00o clerics accused of sex abuse in the US , it has no context unless you add that in the 40 year period covered there were hundreds of thousands of priests and religious serving in the US . 	0
The original sources , one of which was Kamen , actually said that the Spanish Inquisition sentenced 3-4% of convicted people to death over its existence , ( technically , released to the civil authority , ) but that only half of these executions were actually carried out . 	0
I didn ' t quibble about the original quotation , since more qualification would only have made the article longer . 	1

This means including the strange yet notable viewpoints of organizations such as CoS . 	0
If we are going to base our inclusion criteria on characterizations ( viewpoints ) then the article must adhere to the rigors of what NPOV says about viewpoints - in essence , this article must represent all significant viewpoints fairly . 	0
As it stands now though , the article allows for the inclusion of items which are not pseudosciences - yet they are included in the list because some notable source has characterized it as such . 	0
Again , if this article was simply " List of Pseudosciences " where we could only include entries that are either obvious pseudosciences or generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community , then we would not be dealing with this NPOV issue . 	0
" Pseudoscience " is the characterization du jour and Scientology is a notable source ( not a reliable source of labelling something " pseudoscience " , but a notable source nonetheless which has made such a characterization ) . 	0
But this article is not simply a list of pseudosciences ; it is rather a list of characterizations made by notable sources . 	0
If this article were just a list of pseudosciences , then I would agree entirely with you - that Scientology ' s distorted view of science precludes it from representing the scientific community as a whole . 	0

Some of the entries have only been characterized as such by a small fraction of notable sources while the majority of the scientific community wouldn ' t necessarily apply the same characterization . 	0

It could be argued that Catholics suffered more from this , since in most cases their historic faith was suddenly banned and a new one imposed . 	1

Books like the Voices of Morebath show that popular involvement with the Church often decreased with the onset of the Reformation . 	0

Smith , according to his own account , told local clergy about the First Vision and was mocked and scorned over the pulpit in his own community shortly after it had happened . 	1

I still believe that the newspaper articles are appropriate to the discussion specifically because they challenge certain preconceived notions about pre-1900 Mormonism . 	1
Dismissing one academic because one has supposedly taken a class and considers him to be less " mainstream " than the current thought does not change his academic credentials . 	0
Together they do support the idea that Smith did claim to have a vision much earlier than I have read some believe . 	0

This was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led some to accuse him of anti-Semitism .

In the West this was coupled with accusation of describing the Holocaust as a myth [ 25 ] [ 26 ] and of making statements influenced by classic anti-Semitic ideas , [ 27 ] which has led to accusations of anti-Semitism , [ 28 ] though he has denied these accusations , saying that he " respects Jews very much " and that he was not " passing judgment " on the Holocaust . [ 21 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this phrasing and the use of the word " falsely " give rise to the idea that the other allegations of holocaust denial and anti-semitism are false . 	0

I do not feel that it detracts from the encyclopedia . 	0
When it does detract ( from the article ) , then that is due to what is in the Personal life section obviously mattering to people and having something significant in it ; it does not solely have trivial matters . 	0

I don ' t think it ' s helpful to think of it in terms of " many , many more [ governments ] do not consider [ Hamas ] a terrorist organization . " 	1

The scandals have not been covered only in the US ( nor have they occured only in the US ) . 	0
There are similar issues in Ireland and other parts of Europe , and somewhere earlier on this talk page someone brought up a book written about 2000 years of sex scandals in the RCC , so it ' s not necessarily a new thing either . 	0
The first part of the first sentence ( " A sex abuse scandal involving around 0 . 02% of worldwide priests led to recent church reforms to protect against future abuse " ) sounds fine . 	0

The RC article managed for five years without having your favourite scandal in the lead . 	0
Placing it in the lead gives it undue prominence in relevance to the church . 	0

There is no reason why a US sex scandal should be in the lead of this article . 	0
Unless similar things appear in the leads for all other religious organisations and secular ones too . 	0

Since sexual deviancy is a characteristic of human beings , and not just Catholics , as a WP editor with the quality of the article in mind , I second Storm Rider ' s opinion that mention of sexual abuse by clergy does not belong in the lead . 	1
Westcoast , as far as I can tell Storm Rider ' s argument is not that the problem is that of " a collection of a few sinful individuals " but that the normal rates of human sexual deviance are going to be found in the Catholic Church . 	0

However , it is in danger of turning into an edit war , and both sides should discuss the issue here to seek consensus . 	0
This is not vandalism , it is a content . 	0
I can see two solutions : Personally , I prefer my suggested " technically left and rejoined " wording , because with the addition of only 3 extra words it conveys a much richer picture of what happened than either of two disputed versions . 	1
The full situation is explained rather well in a succinct paragraph in the history section , but the " rejoined " summary in the intro could mislead the reader into believing that Northern Ireland tried out life in the Free State for a while before packing its bags and going back to London . 	0
This sort of technical hiatus applies in all sorts of situations , and should of course be described where the issue is considered in detail … but in a one-sentence summary to describe the situation solely as a " rejoining " is misleading . 	1

Also , Brown Haired girl , I don ' t see on Wikipedia that it ' s necessary to always ' compromise ' - sometimes certain people want to imply a position to push a zealous political agenda , and that is something that is very hard to compromise with ( and should not be done ) 	1

Who cares about the meaningless details in a transitional process when all that ' s important is the end result . 	0
For a summary , keep the key facts that allow a new reader to understand what happened . 	0
Adding the word ' technically ' may be correct to an extent , but is still misleading in a summary for someone who knows nothing about Ireland . 	0
BrownHairedGirl - I am against your ' compromise ' proposal , because they are essentially no different than what " O ' Fenian " initially has said , and still implies the same PoV that he wants . 	1
Why in a summary are there no details about many of the other events during the Viking and Norman ages , but for this particular event you feel compelled to add minute and misleading detail . 	0
O ' Fenian has made it clear that he wants the article to imply that partition was the fault of unionists , and for you to add one more word in detail does no more to remove that PoV . 	0

I must remind you that Wikipedia is not censored Yes we may have things here that you may find objectionable but that is not a reason to not include the content if it is freely licensed and appropriate for the topic ( death ) , death and destruction is not pretty and perhaps those who promote it will reconsider after seeing the end results , it ' s not a picture of capital punishment , but appropriate for the murder / homicide section if there is one in this article . 	1

As I said recently , the lead should focus on scientific facts , with minimal mention of social consequences . 	1

Biodiversity does not have to increase . 	1
The current trees produced go back to approx 550 million years back ( based on Cambrian explosion ) , that is our tree of biodiversity based on fossils , molecular similarity , etc etc . The fact that the tree converges to a common ancestor is based on evidence quite different from the evidence used to justify our current tree for biodiversity . 	1
That ' s why biodiversity and common ancestor are two different theories that complement each other . 	0
Saying that drift and selection do not produce diversity is therefore a very wrong statement . 	1
You have to differentiate biodiversity from common ancestor . 	0

" Highway Star " is sort of the prototype for a lot of speed metal and flashy ' 80s stuff , while " War Pigs " was obviously very influential to a lot of the doom metal and ' stoner metal ' material from the ' 70s ( Pentagram , Bedemon ) on . 	0

That being said , many people , but not all , with AIDS test positive for HIV . 	1
To date , there is NOT ONE SINGLE study , paper , reproducible experiment , photograph , video or lab result that supports HIV being the cause if AIDS . 	0
The word empirical denotes information gained by means of observation , experience , or experiment .

Before you make biased and uneducated statements regarding a degree of scientific and linguistic comprehension that are being debated by Nobel Laureates , scientists , doctors and researches the globe over , perhaps you should read a REFERENCE or two supporting your statements . 	0

The CNN article said that : " Before undergoing the transplant , the patient was also found to be infected with low levels of a type of HIV known as X4 , which does not use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells . 	0
A rough analogy would be Al Capone operated Soup Kitchens in the 1930 some people considered him a gangster 	0
Keepcalmandcarryon , I did not state that the treatment causes resistance to CXCR4 I merely pointed out that Hutter ' s patient did have the CXCR4 virus before the treatment which is a fact . 	1
In one of the edits you reverted I had added a CNN article as a reference which had information about this issue . 	0
" This finding is very surprising . " 	0
As such the use of the term " Resistance to CCR5 inhibition is also less important if CXCR4 strains of HIV emerge ( these use CXCR4 rather than CCR5 as a coreceptor , from which they become independent ) , and the patient carried this virus at low levels " is fairly deceptive since it implies that this treatment does nothing for the CXCR4 virus . 	1
However , following the transplant , signs of leukemia and HIV were absent . 	0
" There is no really conclusive explanation why we didn ' t observe any rebound of HIV , " Hutter said . 	0

And also an indication of whether there is a privileged partner status of some sort which means that Israel is one of a special list of allies allowed to buy the current stuff rather then the previous generation of equipment ? 	0

A lot of international aid comes with strings attached - " you can have this amount of money provided you spend it all on buying these overpriced items from these companies based in our nation " . 	0
An up-to-date figure could appropriately be included there but I didn ' t think it was worth using one that was too old . 	0

I ' ve already addressed that argument , several times : Putting aside the veracity of the claim that the charge was " rejected " in the Hezbollah case ( it was not ) , it is irrelevant editorializing to imply that what was claimed in one different instance ( different time , different place , different organization ) is also the case in this instance . 	1
In the discussion above under the heading Misleading Description of Partition , editors are unable to agree on a form of summary wording to use in the lead section of this article to describe the fate of Northern Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . 	1
One side insists that it is right to say that Northern Ireland " remained in the United Kingdom " ; the other prefers to say that it " rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
From what I can see , neither side is wrong , but it appears that the reality is more complex than is implied by either of those short phrases . 	0
The underlying facts do not seem to be in dispute , and are set out in detail both later this article at Ireland # History and also in Northern Ireland # History . 	0
The treaty provided that Northern Ireland would become part of the Irish Free State , but would have the right to opt out and become part of the United Kingdom . 	1
There appears to be agreement that there was clear expectation on all sides that it would do so , and this was done immediately after the treaty came into effect . 	1
The whole process , which involved the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland travelling overland to London to personally present the documents , took 48 hours . 	1
I have seen no suggestion either in this discussion or in related articles that at any point in those 48 hours the Irish Free State had any practical control of affairs within Northern Ireland . 	0
So I suggested a compromise wording : " technically left and rejoined the United Kingdom " . 	0
That has been rejected by both sides , with demands for references for the use of the adjective " technically " . 	0

As well as the sentence been recentist , it paints a bias athiest / protestant centric picture that in the modern day , the Catholic Church has no worth and its only standing is for the sensationalistic American media to whine about its followers and highlight some of the negatives ( sex abuse scandal ) , while giving attention to none of the positives . 	0
That is over 1 billion people challenging the controversy of an athiest pro-death stance ( see how easy words can be twisted to suit a POV ? ) . 	1

You yourself partly justified Elizabeth ' s repressions by referring to the threat of invasion and internal rebellion . 	0

But my reference in the " Proximity to Civilians . . . " section to the Salon article about Hezbollah - - " the same accusation was rejected when it was made during Israel ' s 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . [ 184 ] " - - has been repeatedly removed here without explanation . 	0

Comment Well , it would be strange to " support " myself , but to repeat it : I think that the article needs a lead image that stands for " death " as broadly as possible , at least broadly for human death , which is what the article does focus on . 	0

Using the word sects , but quoting it , clues in the reader that Smith ' s 1830s use of the term may not necessarily mean what the modern reader might think . 	0
It also lets us side-step the question of Smith ' s precise meaning . 	0
I doubt the term sect had the same pejorative connotation in the 1830s as it does today , though certainly Smith was antisectarian , and like any Christian primitivist in the 1820s thought that sects and denominations were a corruption of the Christian church . 	1
But rather than trying to parse the primary sources ourselves ( which could be [ [ WP : OR | original research ) , I think we ought to let the secondary sources guide us . 	0
When Jan Shipps describes the vision story in her Mormonism ( 1985 ) book , page 9 , she uses the word sects in quotes : " this theophany answered the lad ' s question about which of the ' sects ' were right and which were wrong . " 	0
Maybe that ' s the proper approach . 	1
I don ' t think it ' s wrong , or necessarily non-neutral , to use a word like church or denomination in this context , but using Smith ' s own language--like Shipps does--has the added advantage of reflecting the flavor of Smith ' s early anti-sectarian views which he shared with other Christian primitivists . 	0
I know some of the existing secondary sources , like Bushman ' s Smith biography , don ' t really make a distinction between church , denomination , and sect , but that ' s probably just because the authors haven ' t specifically thought of it as an issue . 	0
I guess Bryan R . Wilson would be a very reliable source on the " historical usage " of the term sect . 	0

' Crucifixion of St . Peter , by Caravaggio ' is also POV from a religious viewpoint and we should look for an alternative for this image . 	1

I also notice that the source for throwing the rock has devoted more space to Ahmadinejad discussing Israeli-Palestinian peace talks so I ' m baffled as to why User : LibiBamizrach didn ' t include that in his edit as well considering that is unambiguously more notable than throwing the rock . 	0

This would be a completely useful list , rather than the mess we are working on now ! 	0
My guess as to why we haven ' t adopted this obvious and logical solution is that some editors want so badly to associate certain non-pseudoscientific topics with pseudoscience , that they are willing to throw NPOV and logic out the window just for the satisfaction of including such topics in this muddled and unencyclopaedic list . 	0
Maybe you could be more specific ? 	0
We can ' t allow some characterizations made by one kind of notable source but disallow other characterizations made by another kind of notable source . 	0
This is a blatant breach of NPOV . 	0
The inclusion criteria allows for grey and - per NPOV - all significant grey can and should be included in this list article . 	0
Now then , if that is a problem for us - if we cannot comply with NPOV - then I suggest ( as I have often suggested ) that this article becomes the very definitive " List of pseudosciences " and adheres strictly to the guidelines of WP : PSCI ( part of NPOV ) ; whereas we would only be able to include items which have been deemed pseudosciences per the general opinion of the scientific community . 	0
I absolutely see what you are getting at and agree with you fully . 	0
But where and how do we draw the line ? 	0
We can ' t just allow some grey and disallow others , because " grey " equals " viewpoints " ( i . e . It is the viewpoint of the Society of Foo Skeptics that foo is pseudoscience . 	0
Or Dr . Somewhat Notable has the unique viewpoint that foo is pseudoscience . ) 	0

Also , most of the afforementioned articles do not share Abortion ' s hot-button pedigree , so there is little comparison between other articles ' use of graphic images and this one ' s failure to do so . 	0
I cannot say whether graphic images at Gonorrhea , Feces , or Anencephaly add informative value to those articles , but , I don ' t edit them and so I will leave it to the Wikipedians who do to determine what is appropriate there . 	0
Frankly , the " but other articles do it " defense doesn ' t hold water . 	1
Other than being uninformative , it is my opinion that such images would detract from the quality of this article , by lessening its stringent adherance to NPOV . 	0
Thus , their only function would be argumentative , and this is not the role of an encyclopedia . 	0

After a brief failed attempt to discover when the term ' hard rock ' was coined , I ' ve only found that it ' s been around since at least January 1970 , so as of yet I can ' t knowingly make the argument that ' hard rock ' was a term existing longer than ' heavy metal . ' 	0
There are bands that play ' hard ' ( riff driven , aggressive ) forms of rock , but aren ' t necessarily straight hard rock . 	0
If they were synonymous , why were certain hard rock artists seldom referred to as heavy metal ? 	0
However , I can point out that you didn ' t address one of my previous observations . 	0
I ' m quite aware of the term " heavy metal rock , " and have heard it used . 	0
When do the sources actually say that ? 	0
If " hard rock " is vague in any sense other than its direct relation to metal , it ' s because of its use as an umbrella term , which I suspect is only partially connected to hard rock as a genre in-and-of itself . 	1
From my understanding , it refers to heavy metal . 	0

Burying Mission in Church will really make that important paragraph obscure and placing origins in hisory will make that paragraph disconnect with Beliefs for which it is a logical precursor based on Jesus promise to St Peter " What you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven " . 	0
These two items : Origins and Mission relate to the current activity of the church in the world today - not just history and thus they cant be considered history alone . 	1
Also , I want to add that I thought all of Karanacs comments on Peer Review were fine with a couple small exceptions and I plan to address all of them eventually . 	0
The logic flows well since you have the church being founded and its mission defined which directly affects the formation of its Beliefs . 	1

The church operates its many churches , missions and social ministries around the world today in response to a Gospel event discussed in the Mission paragraph . 	0
Answering the question of Where did it come from is one of the first questions readers will have about the church - see the FA on Islam which actually puts the answers to this question in the lead and expands on it there as well . 	0
Origins tells the reader Where did it come from which I think is an important question to answer up front since the Gospel passage in the origins section is the basis for the church existence . 	0

As to your point about piping , I think your attitude is a little dismissive and your focus a little myopic . 	0
I maintain that finding a Deepwater Horizon link within the phrase " a blowout exploded a Transocean drilling rig " is as intuitive as the example of an appropriate link at the Wikipedia : Piped link # Intuitiveness page you link for me as a tutorial , finding " Pontiac ' s Rebellion # Origins " linked within the phrase " war launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of Native American tribes " . 	0
Now you ' ve changed it to " an explosion destroyed an offshore rig drilling for oil " , with no link at all , again , as if you ' ve got better things to do than properly edit this featured article . 	0
( If you thought it worth a link before , why not now ? ) 	0
The rig was not drilling for oil when it was destroyed by the explosion , as your edit makes it sound . 	1
In fact , the drilling had completely ceased , or the cementing wouldn ' t have commenced 20 hours earlier ; in fact , the rig was basically done there , and about to undergo a routine check before unhitching from the well site and making way to another drilling location . 	0

These combined with the fact that Parker and Stone are on record stating that Butters has become a main character is reason enough to include him as such in the article . 	0

I don ' t really have too much of a problem with this dead-soldier ( though again a more " neutral " John-Doe-on-morgue-slab would be better ) . 	0
If you want to put up a morgue or med-school shot of some anonymous " John / Jane Doe " corpse , I ' d probably be okay with that ( depending in that case however entirely on how likely it seems that some reader out there might be surprised and disturbed to see a deceased relative or loved-one representing this topic - - which again is just another aspect of the same reasoning and in the same way something that Wikipedia probably ought to avoid here . . . ) . 	0

That ' s all . 	0
Choosing a lead image that also contains representations of the subjects of other articles weakens the effect , is distracting , is potentially confusing , and depending on the " other subjects " in question might easily be interpreted as editorial bias ( to the extent , in the case of the Pope , for example , of possibly causing offense to some readers ) . 	0

There are more proofs and evidence suggesting that the content is groundless and untrue manipulated by the current Iran ' s government to justify Ahmadinejad ' s preseidency given that Iranian people have respect and tendency towards educated candidates . 	0
Thus claiming a ranking system in 1976 , 2 years prior to the revolution , is untrue and groundless . 	0
Prior to the revolution in Iran in 1978 , each university has its own entrance exam and no ranking system even existed . 	0
This was the time that the nationwide entrance exam was started as a sample of equity and justice . 	0
The entrance exam and the ranking system started in 1986-1987 and after the universities re-openned . 	0

This is based on capacities as well and the data could confirm the fact that Iranian universities have considerably higher capacities for medical and social sciences than engineering programs . 	0

In general , our articles about politicians try to avoid sections devoted to criticism , and avoid criticism generally , because criticism is not really a pertinent biographical fact about people unless it is tied somehow to their life . 	0
Sometimes a person ' s detractors , or problematic things about them or their actions , are of biographical importance , and they can be included . 	1
For example , in his book Obama recounted drug use in his youth , something that is a significant part of his life story . 	0
We don ' t call it a criticism or a controversy , it is simply an event that happened . 	0
Another thing we avoid is trying to balance articles about people against each other so they are equally or positive or negative . 	1
It just doesn ' t work like that - we would have to calibrate Obama ' s article against not only other presidents , but all of his political rivals , those of heads of state of other countries , and so on . 	0
