I painted this illustration as a way of expressing my frustration at the way America has been heading in recent years . 	0
One of the first cornerstones of America called for the separation of Church and State , and yet issues such as abortion and gay rights have absolutely no redeeming features in a secular context . 	0
In recent years more than ever , right-wing politics has brought religion into the equation - - an exercise that casts incredible aspersions on the very foundations of this nation . 	1

The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings . 	0
this isn ' t about good or bad . 	0
my subjective feeling is that a republican vote is harmful to this country . 	0
i never disputed that . 	0
clearly , republicans have the right to vote . 	0
i really don ' t care if you agree with me or not . 	0
i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0
If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
But , anyway , yeah . 	0
Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0
ARGH ! 	0

I ' d like to clarify . 	0
So so as in REALLY romantic , not so-so as in mildly . 	0
It ' s a pain in the ass to type because only half the keys actually register . 	1
Everyone I know who has gone on holiday gets a cold , is it really windy or something ? 	0
I really don ' t know what the RA could have done about that , but it was very irritating , and brought about many passive-aggressive notes stuck on fridge with magnets . 	0
this year my main concerns are structural ( size of room , will the stairs make me tired , where is the kitchen , TV , laundry etc . ) and not related to RAs that I can figure . 	0
She didn ' t just copy and paste in info or messages , but started out with nice words about whatever time of the semester it was and then got to the purpose of writing . 	0
she also would say hello sometimes , ask how we were doing , but I never felt like I was being detained when I was trying to get something else done ( like walking by and getting sucked in . . . which is a common dorm problem in general . ) probably the worst thing that happened on my hall last year was that people were constantly getting their food stolen from the fridge . 	0
a little reassurance about that would be good . 	0
also , make sure all policies about bathrooms ( if there are any ) , visitors , getting furniture repaired , basic yet useful stuff like that , is very clear from the beginning . 	1
I hope it ' s not too late , just going through the flist and this is one thing I can help on . last year ( when I was a freshman ) I was concerned about showers / bathrooms staying clean ! 	0
I don ' t need immaculate but it was important to me to have it sanitary . 	0
I know I missed something here , but what does " THud " mean ? 	0
Yes , good title ! 	0
ME + pain = 	0
I ' m still mobile but now when I try to get up after sitting to long or try to bend over I look like I ' m 90 . . . . . " hey sunny can ya pass me my cain ? " ouch * * and yes I ' m at work too . 	0
So I guess I didn ' t stretch enough or probably moved wrong at the gym . . . I hurt my lower back . 	1
Hahah , I miss you . 	0
ps - if it weren ' t for all of this " magic happening , " I ' d swear you were on the verge of coming out of the closet . 	0
It ' s not teal walls , but a zebra shower curtain makes me just as sad for you . 	0
