Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0
The publicity for the film gets the film wrong , but I think the film gets this point sort of " right . " 	0
I hear you more clearly . 	0
I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
Does that make any sense ? 	0
Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

The existing intelligence fusion centers are [ theoretically / technically / kinda ] state institutions rather than a centralized federal one , but they ' re funded by federal grants , accountable to federal oversight , and several of them ( if not all - we ' re not sure yet ) are required to share the intelligence they gather with federal agencies . 	0

I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0
( although it does lead to humourous hittings of the öä keys instead of what I was going for , along with adds like the one in my icon ) Hope all is well with you ^_^ 	0

i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0

Sometimes the " I am putting all the food I own into this one meal before it goes bad while I am at home for a week " meal ends up being pretty damn good , but it was not the International Passport with Swedish pancakes and lingonberries . 	0
So I made myself a spinach salad with sliced pears , crumbled bacon , shredded Jarlsberg cheese , and raspberry vinaigrette . 	0
I had every intention of going to the Harvard Square IHOP on Saturday afternoon before flying back home , but I realized that I had a ton of food in my fridge that needed to be cooked and eaten ( including a pound of salmon that had gone bad anyway - FAIL ) . 	0
Does that not mean anything to you ? 	0
I will never understand why there are people in the world who don ' t - it ' s the INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF FUCKING PANCAKES , everyone . 	1

The most frustrating thing about that game , to me , is that the random encounters are literally random . 	1
In more modern RPGs the " random " encounters are calculated in a such a way that they ' re spaced out a bit , though not by a specific amount . 	0

What happened to the Senate , however , shows that Republicans lost seats despite social conservatives having a larger majority of this year ' s vote . 	0
The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is . 	0

I don ' t think it ' s a coincidence that this is also the year I changed my name and left my family behind . 	0

Everyone takes turns opening a gift , and if someone gets something you want , you can steal it from them . 	0

It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1

The only reason our schools are " competitive " is because the administration choose to do things like this : force us to choose between our own school and everyone else . 	0

It ' s generally a bad idea to make one ' s " feminist " argument at the expense of actual women ' s experiences . 	0
if something causes wisps of steam to begin issuing from my ears , I will almost certainly learn something significant from it . 	0
There are folks whose writing I read primarily for that purpose - though a fair chunk of the time , it ' s my own argument that gets vivisected . 	0
That kind of situation is what the phrase " stop being on my side , you ' re making my side look stupid " was invented for . 	0

It ' s not just an academic exercise in utopian philosophy ; real people , with diverse individual needs , will be living the changes we make . 	0
Making feminist arguments at the expense of actual women ' s experiences is , IMO , one of the most significant fracture points within feminism , The reverse is also true : the political is personal . 	0
Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
Kid won , of course . ) 	0
( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep . 	1
He ' s been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure . 	0
He wasn ' t eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply wouldn ' t last . 	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came . 	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself . 	0
He was asleep in moments . 	0
The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat . 	0

I doubt it was her boyfriends fantasy . . . more her own - you know like one of those teenage experiments that everyone seems to have to have whether they are certain about their sexuality or not . 	1
If you haven ' t seen that girl for so long , then I can see why it looks hopeless . 	0
As if it isn ' t difficult enough to start a relationship with someone of the same sex , all that teasing and leading you on confuses the hell out of you . 	0

So in conclusion , California would rather give rights to animals , and take them away from gays . 	1
But alas , they don ' t learn from their lessons ( or maybe they have and would rather be the people that continue the cycle ) . 	0
Of all people that I would have hoped to understand the plight of the repressed minority , I thought the African-American community would have understood . 	0
While California overwhelmingly voted for Obama , Obama also did not support passage of Prop 8 , despite supposed distaste for gay marriage . 	0
Even if it is expensive , at least it ' ll provide jobs and a really cool engineering marvel that the other industrialized countries enjoy now . 	0
But if nothing else , we ' ll get that high speed rail that joins San Francisco with San Diego . 	0
Not everyone lives in a supportive and happy-go-lucky family , and I ' m glad it didn ' t pass . 	0

Our two shepherds ( a ) never enter into pointless marriages , realizing ( if only internally ) that this can ' t possibly match the level of passion they ' ve shared . 	0
The survivor puts the property up for sale , and vanishes into the sunset . . . . 	0
After some time of being excruciatingly careful , one of the two winds up being ambushed , his partner arriving just that much too late , and the one dies in the other ' s arms . 	0
You can still have all the societal disapproval ( once it turns out they ' re not JUST business partners . . . ) and the brutal death , etc . and so on . 	0
OK , so I ' m throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something . 	0
They don ' t have to be " gay " , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID . 	0
I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc . " 	0
Mother Nature : pain in the ass , or super-hot MILF ? 	0
" They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet ' s insecurity since the election of Bush , " she told La Presse . 	0
Full article . 	0
CNN probably unfairly concluded that blacks overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , but it doesn ' t excuse anyone for voting for prop 8 , because a lot of every race was responsible for its passage . 	0
( Actually , the pro-8 people really really twisted it so bad it made me want to puke . ) 	0
We all know religion was what caused the passage , but my main gripe was that people decided to fall on religion instead of their experience to vote . 	0
But let ' s assume that poll conducted by CNN was severely flawed as speculated . 	0
I was more upset that a majority of people who voted for the issue didn ' t see the measure as an issue of rights and equality for all , just about gay marriage . 	0
Again , expectations were turned upside-down , and that was what upset me the most . 	0
Even the Catholic church made a huge push to support 8 as well , but the Hispanics who are usually very religious only barely supported the measure . 	0
So many good ones to choose from ! 	0
Turns out it was the other way around . 	0
I originally thought that the Hispanic population would have overwhelmingly voted for prop 8 , and that the blacks would be 50 / 50 . 	0
Both times I thought to myself , " Why are these old guys flirting with me ? " 	0

In fact , one of the reasons it was not made clear what benefits would be included until today is they announced it before they even figured out what they could put in it . 	0
Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration ' s hate brief on DOMA . 	0

There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0

The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

i love pandas ! 	0
I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0
( And when we get back to the barracks . . . um , never mind . ) 	0
But fight the fight for me ? 	0
Not friggin ' likely . 	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0
( Comment policy for that is , mock at will , but avoid flaming . ) 	0
I know we already talked about this , but I ' ll keep you in my thoughts and prayers . 	0
Stay safe and keep me apprised of the situation . 	0
What does this have to do with your comment ? 	0
My mom used to have a boat and she called it the Laughing Place , because apparently , there ' s a part in that movie where someone says , " everyone needs a laughing place . " 	0

I want to circumvent all that waiting and brainstorm a few of my own for Raleigh . 	0
At university , there were plenty of adventures to be had , but finding most of them took years and knowing the right people . 	0
Would a really fun idea be enough to motivate them to join me ? 	0
For sooooooo long , I ' ve known amazingly gifted people who didn ' t create and would-be adventurers who spent most of their time on the couch or at the bar . 	0

Obviously you can ' t allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy . 	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden . 	0
Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv . 	0
I ' m actually not sure about this issue . 	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life . 	0

Speaking about it later , the subject turned to Tom Lehrer ' s parody of the Major General ' s Song , " The Elements " . 	0
We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0

As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0

The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations . 	0
Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0
If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved . 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0
When idiots start treating this stuff like the elastic clause , you know we ' re screwed when people start believing in the bullshit they spew out . 	0
This is nearly a definition clause in the constitution . 	0
Since where does it say that a no vote will force children to know about same-sex marriage , destroy families , and lead to disintegrating morals ? 	0
Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0
Oddly enough , our fcked up state passed Prop 2 , which mandates that farm animals have adequate room to move around , stretch , etc . Yet , we ' re denying gay folks who have no choice in who they are the rights granted to " normal " people . 	0

But , whatever difference there may be in what men and women do , and in what we expect of them , these differences depend primarily on their different functions as parents . 	0

For instance , on the page opposite the " free and exceptionally gracious " picture , this is what it says : After all , about the greatest difference between you is that boys are made to be the fathers of the world and girls are made to be the mothers . 	0
Because the fathers need to be the protectors , boys are stronger and perhaps more forward and daring than girls . 	0

I ' m still confused by it all although John Simm in a dress made up for some of it . 	0
Your situation ' s balls , but you ' ll survive . 	0
^_^ Best of luck , ganbatte , etc . etc . ! 	0
So I sketched up another to make him happy . 	0
But he called it " slop " . 	0
Sapphy ' s next . 	0
And turned it into a piece of art of only the highest caliber . 	0
So here ' s some wonderful artz for TheWetRabbit , who was in his own way just begging for some ED lovins . 	0
I did these a while ago , but I decided , what the hell , this ain ' t DA , what ' s the worst that could happen ? 	0
So what the hell , I finished it ! 	0
This I drew on OpenCanvas just ' cause when watching The Pagemaster ( Didn ' t bother to finish watching ) on YouTube , and TWR was just begging for internet trouble . 	0
that just made my chest hurt . 	0
eat a cider donut for me . 	0
PS i miss you 	0
Ahh those kind of stories scare me ! ! 	0
yea they did . . the color and composition were ass 	0

You ' ll be in my thoughts , dear . 	0
Good luck . 	0
They ' re making it harder to get a licence up here now too . 	0
yeah : ( its those stupid idiots that give bike riders a bad rep too ! 	0
I was typing in my e-mail , depending on gmail ' s autosave function to save it as I went . 	0
I spent most of my shift at work writing a paper . 	0
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck . 	0
Well , internet explorer just " encountered a problem and had to close " and it turns out gmail wasn ' t autosaving ( at least , not since 5pm when I had only a basic outline finished ) and my whole paper is gone . 	0
Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
Plain . 	0
Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
And there are many measures for that . 	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0
It isn ' t hopeless anywhere in the world . 	0
But it ' s a hell of a climb out of the grave they ' re making us think we ' re digging ourselves . 	0
Some are just more blatant and short-term about their despotic megalomania . 	0
You ' d probably have to travel far less distance , if you ' d have to travel at all , in order to live in a place just as corrupted as the US has become . 	0
Problem is , having lived through that myself , as I say , I ' m not sure it ' s a story I really needed to sit through again . 	0

Thanks , man ! 	0
I ' m so need this magic program ! 	0

Oh how awful for you both . 	1
I still miss my Brodie , 4 . 5 years on , and I remember how fresh and raw the pain was for the first couple of months . 	0
Woah - So I have two P ! @TD that I bought back in March for twenty bucks and as I was looking for Foo ' s tickets for tomorrow , I thought I ' d check to see if there were any Panic ! 	0
Have you any link ? 	0

By cheque you ' d get 100% of the money , so better that way for you really . 	0
Oh I know , I found it that one time : D 	0

It is beyond awesome that you are doing the art for this show . 	0
I especially love the guy throwing his mind out the window ( he lost his mind voluntarily ) . 	0
Also , the moon is often connected with insanity ( which you probably knew , based on this poem ) , so it fits together perfectly . 	0
Well , I agree . 	0
Those panels look GREAT ! 	0
Whatareyatalking about ? ? 	0
But it isn ' t any more hopeless than most of the rest of the world . 	1
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU i would have killed to see that . 	0
It isn ' t like these people and their agenda only exists within the borders of the US or that it ' s an American idea and Americans mean to take over the world starting with their own country . 	0
After all , it ' s a New World Order they ' re aiming for . 	0
I ' m one of the people who is kinda intimidated by you and your many stories but I ' m afraid to tell you that because it would come off as bitchy and maybe it still will . 	0
this looks like a Married to the Sea comic waiting to happen 	0
I saw you at jr_nal , add me back ? 	0

I ' ll be a guinea pig for the project . 	0
googling that , i discovered that it was probably loaded with a virus / spyware / malware , and so one shouldn ' t do it and just delete the movie . . 	0
how was the performance ? ? ? 	0
Tried a site and after completing the download of two movies and going to watch them via my VLC media player ( plays all / most codecs flawlessly ) , got the ominous message " To play this movie , you need to download moviexplayer from X " . . 	0

This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0
How have we , as citizens in this Land of the Free , come to spit in the face of our Founding Fathers ? 	0

Don ' t worry about the e-mail ; I was only dropping you a-line because I figured you were bed ridden and in need of social e-mails = D Get some rest and feel better ! 	1
Why should they deny any rights to homosexuals from a few verses in the Bible ? 	1
Bop it ! 	0

Do you really think , if he wasn ' t there to do it , you wouldn ' t pick yourself up ? 	0
You don ' t really need someone to save you . 	0
But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there ' s no one to crawl into bed with you . 	0
That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0
Well , yeah , and the NSA too . 	0
Still , domestic intelligence ? 	0
Mocking the Catholic church at this stage in history is almost redundant . 	0

Was he ahead of his time ? 	0
However , I like " indian " music , so this fit into my existing likes . 	0
Holy shit that is cool . 	0
Is that a white dude ? 	0
On the upside you don ' t actually have to attend any of the lectures if you don ' t feel you need to . 	0
Yes there are lectures on Saturdays . 	0
It ' d be easy to get to cons , has a long battery life , and best of all , isn ' t expensive . 	0
You . . . should get a netbook . 	0
Also , are you going to Anthrocon later this year ? 	0
You could probably pay it off with the savings you get by not running the fan at those speeds all the time . 	0
I ' m not making it out to FC , and it ' d be cool to hang out with you for a while . 	0

Hey i ' m not sure i ' ll find out for you now . 	0

I ' m good at finishing hardwood floors ! 	1
I love the teddiesss ; u ; Which colour did you like best ? 	0
amazing ! 	0
don ' t start today though - lets wait and see if anyone else is in then we can all do it together , i think we ' ll all be more motivated to do it that way xx 	1
I ' m not an expert , but I ' m also going to be doing this on our floors in a couple of months . 	0
I think , if I had it to do over again , I would concentrate more on the edges and use non-water-soluble poly . 	0
They ' re currently working on our house , but should be done and looking for a new project in February or March . . . 	0

I ' ll be DJ ' ing at + one tonight come and enjoy a night out with some excellent music ! 	0
However , you can ' t do that with everyone . 	0
well being honest with some people is good . 	0
but since you don ' t like the " best friend " idea . 	0
I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0
Ermm . . . 	0
I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0
Why ? 	0
Ok , that kinda means that being confrontational with everyone is a bad idea . 	1
I guess if you are willing to get along with fewer people , then it ' s really no big deal . 	0
My sympathies and love are with you both . 	0

I suspect this has to do with a keyboard-interface-related mental trigger - certainly my phrasings , and I ' m pretty sure my debative skills and tactics , become sharper and more precise , when I ' m resisting the temptation to descend into ad hominem arson ( " I may be a skunk , but you ' re a piece of junk . 	0

Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories : 1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil . 	0
2 ) Dudeman , at age 85 , has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that ' s affected him from investigating over 70 , 000 cases of demonic possession over his career . 	0
That senile dementia is now causing him to see shadows where there are none . 	0

Cakes , why do they all look like cakes ? 	0
It ’ s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts . 	0
True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

I was off work for 2 weeks after a hernia op then a few days after going back I was like an old man . 	0

I ' m not entirely sure how it happened , but I somehow ended up with a boyfriend . . . the most fantastic boyfriend in the entire world , to be precise ! 	1
I ' m really happy . . . although I ' m still in denial that this all happened . . . it ' s too Hollywood , stuff like this doesn ' t happen in real life ! 	1

Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
So marked . 	0
But it seems much to long to wait ! 	0

: / Those who voted for Prop 8 either voted out of fear / discrimination of homosexuals or because they were following what their church told them like sheep . 	0
Never once has it entered their mind that they might be wrecking their fellow Americans ' lives . 	0
The problem , as I see it , is that people still vote for selfish interests rather than trying to protect their fellow citizens and their rights . 	1
It ' s the difference between a millionaire voting Democrat because they figure they could stand to lose a couple thousand a year for the good of the economy or voting Republican because they want to keep their private jet running . 	0

this LJ is a place for me to express my unbridled and extremely subjective thoughts and feelings . 	0
this isn ' t about good or bad . 	0
my subjective feeling is that a republican vote is harmful to this country . 	0
i never disputed that . 	0
clearly , republicans have the right to vote . 	0
Abigail 	0
i really don ' t care if you agree with me or not . 	0
i don ' t think they are idiots because they don ' t agree with me . i think they are idiots because their premises alienate and destroy . 	1
i don ' t care who the person is , if they have republican beliefs ( such as unregulated corporations , independence at the expense of the community , free market capitalism ) and more specifically social conservative beliefs ( such as being opposed homosexual marriage and social programs and believing in a version of family values based on twisted theology ) then i believe their beliefs are selfish , ignorant , and exceedingly adverse . 	0

If there is such a thing as memes ( and the theory ' s proponents say that they are things ) , then this is the meme equivalent of engineering weapons-grade strains of the Bird Flu . 	0
I think if you set out by saying , " Hey guys , I am starting this new meme , " then it is definitely not a meme . 	0
It ' s like infecting someone with a disease on purpose and saying they " caught " it . 	0
And if you don ' t agree it ' s only because the meme that makes you think otherwise is a strong one . 	0
But , anyway , yeah . 	0
Well , I actually don ' t much care for the term in general , as it means engaging with a corner of philosophy of the mind that I find a little silly . 	1
In its stronger forms , meme theory suggests that there ' s no such thing as human consciousness or thought because our brains are just spongy , meme-infested piles of goop . 	0

All other things being equal , I ' d take the intelligent plain one over the dumb beauty . 	1
Except if they were both jerks , in which case I ' d stay single . 	0
The problem isn ' t really that I can ' t fake it ( although sometimes I can ' t ) , it ' s more that it leaves me absolutely exhausted and loathing my job . 	0

In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0

That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1

You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0

Hm , well YepRoc ' s site is not online right now . 	0
maybe it ' s not that they didn ' t want to fuck you before , but just feel safer telling you once you ' re in a relationship and they can ' t really act on it ? 	1

        For the record : I haven ' t seen it , so I really have no opinion as of yet ; however I ' m probably gonna wait on this one - - I ' m just not a fan of Westerns .   Even though its really a movie about sheepherders .   Technically . 	0
It is streamable from YepRoc - - matter of fact I should update the post with a link to that . 	0

I keep hearing people say things like " best record since Element of Light " and " Best Record since I Often Dream of Trains " - - I ' m hesitant to say that kind of thing because I ' m not a critic ; but it is certainly in a league with Robyn ' s very best work . 	0

I ' ll have to ask Fay how she cooked their rooster - he turned out very tasty . 	1
What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0
And no , the story needn ' t have a " happy ending " in order to be satisfying . 	0

What ' s really pissing me off is watching a liberal reporter tour damaged areas of Lebanon with a representative of Hezbollah while he whines about what the Israelis are doing to their cities . 	1
WTF ? 	0
Maybe if your rag-headed leader hadn ' t ordered the invasion of Israel , and the kidnapping of troops they wouldn ' t be shelling the fuck out of your little hidey holes , which happen to be in civilian areas . 	0
Cowardly fucks . 	0

I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

I know that many animators have been pushing for some kind of official rerelease just because the segments with Brer Rabbit are just damn good animation , but otherwise it wasn ' t hugely financially or critically successful and really didn ' t quite fit next to other live action / animation hybrid family films like Mary Poppins or Bedknobs and Broomsticks on the Disney Classics shelves . 	0
The most labor any black person does is cooking , there ' s no bloody uprising , nobody is beaten , bought or sold . 	0
Remus does get a browbeating from the mother and grandmother for telling stories to the kid , and he does get very " no mam , yessum " humble and even depressed about it , but that ' s as bad as things get . 	0
Not bad as in imoral , but bad as in just poor quality . 	0
It ' s not ever overtly offensive or in any way compelling durring the live segments , but Remus does look tweeked out of his gord durring Zippadee Doo Dah and whenever the little boy cries his transforms into the vissage of a demon . 	0
thank you ! 	0
For two reasons : the animation is some of the best done character animation that exists and because the live action elements are VERY badly written , acted and directed . 	0
So yeah , my basic thoughts ? 	0
It ' s not a great film , the worries about racism are far overblown , the kid ' s a demon , the animation is beautiful . 	0
i added you . 	0

" I ' m much clearer on what ' s problematic about # 5 : it subtly assumes that a woman , at any rate a pregnant woman , needs a man , and glosses over the injustices that create that need . 	0
Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
Nevertheless , if I ' ve parsed this right , I ' m more radical than not . 	0
