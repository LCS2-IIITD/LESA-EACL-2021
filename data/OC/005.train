Gay , bi , or whatever , I think that ' s the lesson I learned , and the film is about what happens if you * don ' t * learn and apply that lesson . 	0

I suppose I could agree with you and still go in a slightly different direction : I think stunted passion can drive people to lead lives in which they appear to be passionless . 	1
It ' s not an easy mindset to recall after nearly a decade being out of the closet , but I would say that I spent a good deal of my 20s , when I felt both uncomfortable with my own sexuality and isolated about being who I was , using my drive and my power as an intellectual , emotional , and spiritual being to either route my passion anywhere BUT sex , or to holding myself in . 	0
In a sense , what the movie gets " right " for me happens most clearly with Ennis ' s character : the force of nature of his passion is one he devotes to containing himself , rather than trying to break free . 	0
And he does fail to contain himself in many ways . . . but what ' s tragic is that had he failed a little more , he might have been able to succeed at something a lot more fulfilling . 	0
Does that make any sense ? 	0
Maybe one way I could come at it is nothing more than this : I had a couple of clunky , difficult relationships with women before I came out as a queer man , and I ' ve had a couple of decent relationships with women since coming out , fucking around with a lot of men , and giving my whole heart and soul to a couple of men over the years . 	0
Which is to say : although my desires for women are a fairly small part of my overall makeup , I could only express them decently once I took the brakes off my WHOLE self . 	0

The folks they officially grant permission to perform exorcism are supposed to be levelheaded enough to avoid this kind of bad press , while still combating the possessions the Church has to believe occur now and then . 	0
It seems counterintuitive , but the Church knows just as well as anyone how ridiculous they would look treating every rebellious teen as possessed , or what have you . 	0
The chief of the branch should be even more responsible than the run-of-the-mill exorcist , not less . 	0
Yes . 	1
Well , frankly ? 	0
The job of exorcist is supposed to be rather like folks involved in canonization - to be skeptical , seek solid evidence , then act - not to see devils everywhere and try to solve every problem with exorcism . 	0
I don ' t believe in their party line , but they do , and this is inconsistent with what the job is supposed to entail , if I remember correctly from Catholic Boot Camp . 	0

the only way to bring in people that reflect solid liberal and progressive values ( aka decent people with hearts and intelligence ) is to vote them in on a local level . 	0

I do not prefer it , but by nature I am submissive , noncombative , noncompetitive , and relatively easygoing , which means I can pull it off and generally people describe me as easy to work with . 	0

THEN push your hair down carefully with either a wide toothed brush / comb or even your fingers cause that shit seriously turns your hair into hard candy . 	0

There ' s been a lot of race-baiting going on lately , and I just wanted to assuage that . 	0
if your hair is dirty ( and unteased ) spray some dry shampoo through it first , then try teasing two or three times . 	0
No . . . it ' s all gone ? 	0

Hello ! 	0

as a person with a folklore degree , they ' re kinda slavery era in that when joel chandler harris collected them they were told him by a black male who was either a neighbor or a servant of the family ( i suddenly can ' t recall which ) . 	0
really the stories are variations on african folk tales , existing american folktales ( like jack tales ) and some elements and stories were " created " so to speak or altered during the slave years , but not all of them . 	0
they ' re really a mishmash of traditional stories , especially trickster tales and the trickster in every other element of american and really every society is an admired figure who sticks it to the status quo . 	0
they ' re cautionary tales and fables as well - it ' s sad that they ' re dismissed so readily by people who ' ve probably never even read them . 	0
they definately do not promote or condone slavery in the least - if anything they ' re against it , as the hoovmeister said . 	1
all folktales , regardless of when they were created or under what circumstances , are an integral element of our society and to ignore them or media stemming from them is doing a serious disservice to our youth . 	0
it saddens me that folklore ' s basically dying out between the encroaching technology and political correctness . 	0
in terms of the uncle tom-like remus as lucas mentioned , you rarely saw beatings and uprising in folktales - folk songs , yes - folk tales , not so much . 	0
the space really gave you some creative space . . 	0

People also don ' t like to look at relisted auctions , and I relsited two . 	0
It might be because I listed sweaters and girdles instead of dresses and coats , it might be because of competition from other sellers ( let ' s face it Ebay is so overstocked , it can be hard to get your auctions looked at ) . 	1
I began to change stuff ( gallery pic format , layout / background , user ID ) because of the slowness / lower number of hits on my auctions . 	0

It doesn ' t matter to me why this is , people can protest for their own reasons yet still be protesting the same thing . 	0

I also think I ' m going to go back and add more spot blacks on the sidewalk . . . part of my challenge to myself with this is to get better at spotting blacks ( I ' m terrible at it ) , so I ' m trying to suggest light and form as much with straight black and white as I can , at least at first . 	0
I think it looks a lot better , but we ' ll see once I ' ve stepped away from it long enough to get a new perspective . 	0
I ' ve already lettered the next tier and decided to go use the smaller nib I have . 	0

Obviously everyone except for Wilf is protected by not having fully human DNA and thus being immune to the overwrite . 	0
So are we supposed to assume that the only non-Master people left on the planet are Wilf , the Doctor , Donna , and maybe the green people ? 	0
The Naismith family also needs some background info , as well as the green people . 	0
Still , how does a former prime minister gather a crazed group of disciples ? 	0
Presumably , because at the end of series three they only rewound to right before the arrival of the American convoy , there ' d still be stuff left about Saxon ' s existence . 	0

What makes it even harder is the fact that she is admittedly open to both sexes , which makes things seem even more possible , but I don ' t know how to reconcile my feelings for her . 	0
I have been struggling with this for a really long while and she has expressed interest in meeting me as well . 	0
I really , really want to meet her , but I am afraid because I don ' t know what to expect , if anything . 	0
Thank you for the opportunity to get this off of my chest . 	0
I can ' t seem to get over this insane crush that I have on a girl that I met in the Colbert community . 	0
She and I have a lot in common and I always eagerly await her comments , replies , etc and find myself wanting to do things for her and talk to her , but I already have someone in my life and it is frankly really confusing . 	0
Part of me is telling myself to be careful because I already have someone , but another part of me really wishes that I could go for her . 	0
I honestly have little attraction to men as a rule in the physical sense , so personality , talents , mannerisms , and interests become more of the basis for my feelings for someone . 	0

After you kill Arthas , there ' s this long RP / cinematic where Bolvar Fordragon , whom Arthas had captured and tortured , took up the helm and sword and became the new Lich King so that Azeroth wouldn ' t go cablooey . 	0

Yep , way way preachy but you don ' t need anyone and neither do I . Sticking around for a need is worse than leaving . 	0

I use Photobucket because it ' s easy and the service it provides is enough for what I do ( read : not a lot ) . 	0
But I wouldn ' t recommend it if you intend on linking a lot of people to it because it has a tendency to go " OMG TOO MANY PAGE VIEWS EXCEEDED BANDWIDTH WE ARE GONNA MAKE DIS IMAGE UNAVAILABABLE UNTIL NEXT MONTH ! " 	0
I -could - be wrong about it , but I ' m pretty sure I ' m not . 	0
I was going to suggest Facebook , but FB has a 60 image limit per album and uploads can be a bit of a bitch . 	1

i seem to have successfully extracted myself from academia , for the time being - - somehow managed to graduate last sunday - - and have landed in the most mahvelous summer job at the tar pits as the assistant excavator and it ' s like summer camp , only better , because i get PAID to learn anatomy and hang out with the loveliest people and i HURT everywhere my last day at the vile lawfirm was tuesday first day at the museum on wednesday and five days straight excavating since then and i hurt EVerywhere my back , my right arm , my left palm , my abdominal muscles , my feet - - which is bizarre because i spend most of my day lying on my stomach , leaning over a 3 x 3 foot grid of asphalt picking at dead animals and i am just so thrilled to be in so much pain it ' s great and i don ' t have a paper to write ! 	1

I have issues with " film critics " who insert their own visions of what they believe is " proper sociology " --whether it ' s a homophobic straight man sniffing at the concept of two men , or homo-superior asswipes who believe that how THEY met and how THEY live THEIR lives should be the universally-accepted way of depicting man-to-man relationships without accepting differences or nuances . 	0
Some people have issues with the story . . . others don ' t want to deal with the hype about it . . . . others see something to it . . . and all points of view are fine . 	0
As difficult as it may be to crack the shells some of us use to protect ourselves from life ' s difficulties and frustrations , you learn nothing about yourself if you choose to learn nothing from the experiences of others , fictional or not . 	0
I ' ve had my own experience in losing people and property by murder , death , robbery , and accident to know that it ' s awful to live through and easier to deal with with the compassion of others . 	0
I don ' t have to live through a hurricane myself in order to do SOMETHING to help people affected by one . . . 	0
Putting it another way , my mother never had to understand my " thing " for facial hair and particular traits in men in order for her empathize with my need for male companionship . . . she knows the need for male companionship satisfied by my dad . . . 	0
If you can ' t put yourself in a position to either sympathize or empathize with at least one of the things you credit to my " logic " , then the storyline will hold nothing for you . . . and that would be unfortunate . 	0
No , you don ' t need to be bi male shepherds on a mountain in Wyoming to " legitimately " comment on it . . . for you to UNDERSTAND the story , you need to be able to sympathize or empathize with the characters and their situation . 	1
And that is bullshit posturing not worth the electrons that carry their spew of " holding court " . 	0
I think most movie critics are full of pompous self-centered hot air to begin with , and these guys worry too much about the genre and storyline than they do about the technical expertise of the screenplay or the quality of the cinematography or direction or production , or the artistic value of the sound track or skills of the actors . 	0
Aha ! 	0
Yes , it was completely anonymous . 	0
Nice picture , though ! 	0
Omg , that is hilarious . 	0

Shit , I should ' ve known that ! 	0
God damn . 	0
I ' ve heard the argument that the film sugarcoats slavery , and being a Disney movie I don ' t see how it couldn ' t , but I ' m betting Song of the South is much less Rascist than Gone with the Wind , and not nearly as bad as Birth of a Nation , but every film student is forced to watch those pieces of crap at least once . 	0

And honestly , if I wanted to have a screenshot of a site to make it look nice , I ' d probably at least consider using Safari ; the stuff is more typographically " correct " using that rendering , which in the context of an image of a site may well look better . 	0
A lot of people seem to prefer it , though . 	0
Will go fix , thanks ! 	0
Heh , this is what happens when I model for stuff - apparently my hands ( esp . thumb ) do not behave like normal people ' s . 	0

We were actually in the same room with David Shrigley at the gallery and didn ' t realize it . 	0
We were all saying how cool the show was and how much we liked it and he just sat there with his back to us and didn ' t even turn around , so that made me think that maybe he isn ' t as awesome as everyone thinks . 	1

The most frustrating thing about that game , to me , is that the random encounters are literally random . 	1

What happened to the Senate , however , shows that Republicans lost seats despite social conservatives having a larger majority of this year ' s vote . 	0
The passage of these measures reflects a conservative majority , however slim that is . 	0

It ' s better / easier for me if I use packaged egg whites , because then I have a hope of using the " leftovers " before they go bad . 	1
As to why I don ' t have shell eggs , it ' s twofold : I do better when I avoid egg yolks , and my use of eggs in general is mostly for baking . 	0
So as long as I keep that in mind and reduce the oil by at least 1 / 3 , it should be okay . 	0
Really , the only thing likely to give me fits is the egg / oil mix , because I ' ve found that my egg white breads don ' t " hold " the oil the same way when made with whole eggs . 	1
I don ' t have any milk-milk , so I ' ll need to reconstitute some from powder , then measure it , because I ' m not sure exactly how much powder and water are needed for three tablespoons ( 2tsp of powder and 8tsp of water ? ) and with quantities in this range , there ' s less tolerance for error , but that ' s not bad . 	1

Mind you , Canada isn ' t perfect , by any means ; another part of why it was possible for me is because my family was supportive - I ' d have been in a much more precarious position if they weren ' t . 	0
Kid won , of course . ) 	0
( My son ' s father didn ' t even get an opt-in ; he was . . . not very stable - but again , Canadian conditions meant I only had to consider that problem in terms of the personal , weighing fairness to him against what it could mean for my baby if he took it into his head to try for custody . 	0
I ' m pretty sure we ' re at least close to the same page - it ' s partly because Canada has some of those social and legal conditions that I was able to let my daughter ' s father opt out . 	1
( IOW , I think he might be a Nice Guy ( tm ) . ) 	0
What I suspect here is that he has a vested interest in not changing the institutional injustices , because in a just world , women wouldn ' t need men . 	0
I suspect the latter , because of him bringing up " pregnancy is so dangerous " as an argument supporting mandatory support - the only connection I can see between them is that the financial support would mean better health care ( assuming the father , or his parents , have or are able to earn enough to make a difference ) and an improved , but not risk-free , outcome ; otherwise , obligating the father ' s involvement has no effect on those dangers ( or may have a negative effect ) . 	0
I ' m not so sure the KiSA is on your side ; he didn ' t seem to have the slightest interest in the injustices I was trying to talk about - at best , he ' s convinced they ' re immutable ; at worst , he ' s got a hidden agenda . 	1

About 12 hours ago Matoko and I made the tough decision that it was time for her cat , Baldric ( aka , bodge ) , to be put to sleep . 	1
He ' s been fighting off heart troubles , hyperthyroid , and possible kidney issues , and last night , after his latest downturn , we were told that he was experiencing massive kidney failure . 	0
He wasn ' t eating , was getting sores in his mouth , and though the vet did say there was a chance to bring him around , it simply wouldn ' t last . 	0
In the end , I think he was glad that we could all be together when his time came . 	0
He sat with us , purred his love for Liz , and then settled down for the injection itself . 	0
He was asleep in moments . 	0
The house is a little emptier , now , without our big black fighter of a cat . 	0

They manage to scrape together the money for their own ranch , and indeed have a period of some happiness together , during which they wind up shooting to death a couple shitheads who come to their spread with the intent of killing our protagonists - in circumstances that make it clear it was self defense . 	0
Our two shepherds ( a ) never enter into pointless marriages , realizing ( if only internally ) that this can ' t possibly match the level of passion they ' ve shared . 	0
The survivor puts the property up for sale , and vanishes into the sunset . . . . 	0
After some time of being excruciatingly careful , one of the two winds up being ambushed , his partner arriving just that much too late , and the one dies in the other ' s arms . 	0
You can still have all the societal disapproval ( once it turns out they ' re not JUST business partners . . . ) and the brutal death , etc . and so on . 	0
OK , so I ' m throwing in some cliches here as shorthand , but the point is all that passion drives them TO something . 	0
They don ' t have to be " gay " , they just have to NOT be utterly fucking STUPID . 	0
I don ' t recall the characters in the story being portrayed as being particularly dim , so I find it difficult to believe that EVEN in the given setting , it ' s impossible for them to conceive of a way to be together that would slip under the radar , or behind the common presumptions of the time , at least for a while . 	0
I ' m no stranger to holding a minority opinion in a variety of fields , but it ' s been rare that I ' ve gotten this much personal hostility over openly stating I dislike a particular story , and that I can ' t for the life of me understand why people are cumming all over themselves about it . 	0

The McLellan family had written to Canadian senators to say they cancelled a vacation in Canada because of the hunt , which they called " horrible " and " inhumane , " Montreal ' s La Presse reports . 	0
While I don ' t at all agree with the seal hunt , I give huge props to this : Senator fires back at U . S . family upset with seal hunt A Liberal senator has replied to a family in Minnesota upset about Canada ' s seal hunt with a letter denouncing the United States for executing prisoners at home and killing people in Iraq . 	0
She said Americans are not in a position to criticize others . 	0
In her response , Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette said that what she finds horrible is " the daily massacre of innocent people in Iraq , the execution of prisoners – mainly blacks – in American prisons , the massive sale of handguns to Americans , the destabilization of the entire world by the American government ' s aggressive foreign policy , etc . " 	0
" They must start to look at their own behaviour , the permanent heightening of the planet ' s insecurity since the election of Bush , " she told La Presse . 	0

petrona has seen me with the kids , but she wanted to see how I ' d act when the kids were in my space . 	0

Nope , it wasn ' t either . 	0

Formulation of this may have been started back in January , but somehow it disappeared and the administration has admitted this is only being done because some big money gay donors started to pull out of a big DNC fundraising soiree over the administration ' s hate brief on DOMA . 	0

Feminism isn ' t about knowing the answers , it ' s about trying to find them . 	0
It ' s a bit stream-of-consciousness ( as the title warns ) , but there ' s a good deal of sense in it . 	0
There are feminist theorists who have posited that full equality will only be possible when all babies are grown in vitro - a stance that at least proposes a solution , rather than shaking its fist at the slings and arrows of outrageous biology , but . . . well , rather than writing yet another essay in a comment , I ' ll just say I find it extreme . 	0

My Favorite Characters : Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Cartoonist Mike Kunkel is brilliant in every sense of the word- - and much like Little Nemo in Slumberland , this book captures the heart and imagination , bringing out the wide-eyed child in even the most jaded person . 	0
Herobear and the Kid ! 	0
Not exactly the sort of thing a ten-year-old would want to play with , but he soon " learns not to judge a bear by its cover " ( oh , the bad pun . 	0
The book revolves around young Tyler , who receives an old broken locket and a stuffed bear as an inheritance when his grandfather passes away . 	0
For the little toy bear can magically transform into the 10 foot tall super hero polar bear named HEROBEAR . . . and the rest is history . 	0
it hurts ) . 	0

A quick summary is that Apple want the fonts to look nice , whereas Microsoft want the text to be more readable . 	0
After my post a bit earlier in Windows Safari , kurisu posted this fascinating article on the differences between Windows and OS X ( and now Safari for Windows ) font rendering , which has puzzled me for ages . 	0

And allowing men to skip out entirely on responsibility for their offspring leaves single moms in the lurch . 	0
The only good thing about this whole nightmare is seeing how loving and selfless people are being towards the victims of this fire . 	0
And that doesn ' t even touch the vast differences between the lives we are able to live NOW versus the experiences of non-urban gay and bi men prior to the 1970 ' s . 	0
It ' s one thing to not understand what you ' ve never experienced , it ' s another thing entirely to disdain what you don ' t understand without making an attempt to walk a mile in the boots you turn your nose up over . 	0
You have to apply your OWN experiences and ability to read non-verbal communication and pluck yourself out of L . A . or Cambridge and the life you live NOW in order to feel the impact of the setting and circumstances of the story . . . and if you ' ve never been in love , never lived with vast distance between you and someone you love , never lived in small-town rural America , never lived with having nearly everyone in a 20-mile radius KNOWING you and your family , never lived with all those people who are the extent of your known world putting very exacting expectations on how you will live and die . . . then you will have trouble connecting with the film and the story . 	0
The story of " Brokeback Mountain " is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself --not something that grabs you by the shoulders and says " Oh , Bob--I LOVE YOU ! " and turns into a chick-flick full of flowery prose and verbal vomit that leads you to big block letters saying " THIS IS A LOVE STORY . . . YOU CAN TELL FROM THE LINES . " 	1
And while Mars-Jones may have worked with Edmund White and spent some time in Charlottesville , Virginia , I have serious doubts if the Brit truly grasps the lives of rural Americans who are NOT in the " ivory tower " . 	1
I agree with you whole-heartedly about Ehrenstein--he probably has never stepped outside of his little world to see , much less understand , how rural gay AND bisexual men live outside his little bubble of long-term happy partnership in a place where the dirtiest thing one encounters is the street person he passes on the sidewalk and inhabits the happy land of make-believe of movies and live-as-queerly-as-you-want-without-fear . 	0
They are happy to be urban--and urbane- - " queers " of 2005 , and they never presume to " lower themselves " to understand lives that are different from their own . . . very much like the Log Cabin Republicans who are more concerned about taking care of their POSESSIONS than they are about the big-picture of what their political support does to us as a minority population . . . as " W " has no clue or compassion regarding the outcomes of his policies , since he has never lived with privation , never had to worry about how he would pay the bills if his job went away because someone always swooped in to fix things for him if things fell apart in his private life . 	1
That is the big problem with blowhards like them- - they have never experienced the isolation and loneliness and societal pressure put on less-than-college-degreed rural American gay and bisexual men . . . therefore the story and the premise means NOTHING to them . 	0
I ' m pretty numb right now and trying to stay that way so I don ' t have a meltdown . 	0
But it always leads to lives and potential unfulfilled when love is thwarted . . . and depression , too . 	1
It ' s a love story alright . . . but it ' s a tragedy , too . . . passion between two people does not always lead to a happy conclusion when conditioning from childhood and reinforcement by a society that can ' t be separated from your own life makes your allegiance to compliance more important than what you love . 	0

Enh . . . given that part of the job of Holy Mother Church is to protect the common man from the influence of the Adversary , saying that he has taken control of leaders of the Church isn ' t exactly good CYA - particularly from the head of the folks in charge of recognizing and rebuking his manifestations . 	1

I think my spiffy new icon tells you quite a lot about what I , as a feminist , think of men ( however they identify ) who want to slay villains for me . 	0
As I ' ve already mentioned , I ' m down with ( authentic ) male feminists ; they are my brothers-in-arms , and I ' m very glad to have them fighting beside me , watching my back , and all those other good warrior metaphors . 	0
( And when we get back to the barracks . . . um , never mind . ) 	0
But fight the fight for me ? 	0
Not friggin ' likely . 	0
So - you can see Sir Lancelot in action at Derek ' s Doing Feminism - not Derek ; you should have no trouble identifying the guy in the tin suit in the comments , even before I take him to task . 	0
Since ol ' Lance has already transformed himself into Brave Sir Robin and flounced ( ' bout a six , I figure ; the execution was technically quite good , if unoriginal , until he spoiled it by coming back for one parting shot ) , there ' s little point in piling on him there ; I doubt it ' ll penetrate his + 4 Armor of Complacence ( what , surely you don ' t think he won ' t sneak back to see how we took it ? ) , and it ' ll just distract further from what could be a very productive discussion ( which you could join if you ' re so inclined ) . 	0
Anyway , it wouldn ' t be courteous to Derek . 	0
And , since I ' m going to mention over there that I ' ve snarked about it here , with link , chances are we ' ll have a meal of Silly Knigget deliver itself right to my doorstep - dinner ' s on me ! 	0

The story IS depressing and cathartic , yet very necessary--it ' s about US , even if we haven ' t lived through all the experiences of the characters ourselves . 	0

  And you are keeping the really really old cars on the road .   Plus you are creating economic hardship for the lower income folks .   	0

I am so tired of hearing about this Cash for Clunkers bullsh * * .   Don ' t people have any sense at all ? 	1
  You don ' t want to take the " nicer " used cars off the road .   What are the lower income people going to drive ?   These are the cars they would have bought used .   Now they are going to be forced into driving even older cars .   You take all the " nicer " used cars off the road and destroy them . . .   You are not improving the enviorment .   You are just creating hardship for the lower income people . 	1

( On the flip side , I also know some men who ' ve been devastated by their girlfriends having abortions--and going " tough noogies sperm donor , you don ' t own her " is just not the answer I can give a close friend who ' s grieving because he thought he would be a father . ) 	0
Thanks ! 	0
I don ' t know an entirely good solution though . 	0
Obviously you can ' t allow men to dictate whether or not women abort or give up the pregnancy . 	0
Now the guys have to choose between unplanned marriage or a serious financial burden . 	0
Both of the girls were teenagers and their intentions , as far as I could tell , were to secure marriage and thus Twu Wuv . 	0
I ' m actually not sure about this issue . 	0
I know two men whose girlfriends assured them that they were on birth control and would get an abortion if it failed , then promptly presented the guys with a blue stick and a sudden conversion to pro-life . 	0
But the idea of someone being forced to be a father doesn ' t make me happy either . 	0

I mean , if you think of " the Devil " as " the personification of evil , or as an anthropomorphic conception of evil " , and sex abuse is evil , and the coverup of evil is evil , and the coverup of the sex abuse came from within the Vatican , then , well , yes , the Devil is at work inside the Vatican . 	0

Speaking about it later , the subject turned to Tom Lehrer ' s parody of the Major General ' s Song , " The Elements " . 	0
We talked about performing that for the next recital later this year , but I decided not to because it would be too similar . 	0
However , I did decide I should sing one of Tom Lehrer ' s pieces , I just have to decide which one . 	0
What Tom Lehrer song do you think I should sing ? 	0
Cece and I have been taking voice / singing lessons for a while now : She because she is in a chorus , and me just for fun . 	1
Anyway , our voice teacher held a recital the other week where each of his students performed . 	0
I sang " What a Wonderful World " ( made famous by Louis " Satchmo " Armstrong ) and " Modern Major General " from Gilbert and Sullivan ' s " The Pirates of Penzance " . 	0

mshollie and I enjoyed seeing " The Princess and the Frog " yesterday . 	0
As a film with both New Orleans and frog themes , how could we resist going ? 	0
The use of sterotype " Southern " accents , as I ' ve mentioned too common in films set in New Orleans was unfortunately not avoided , and at first was quite distracting . 	0
I thought just a couple plot of twists were too incredible even after accepting the conceits of people changed into frogs and talking animals . 	0
The animation is excellent , with interesting effects such as different styles for sequences showing characters ' fantasies . 	0
Interesting characters and pretty good plot , with a good amount of nuance to keep things interesting for the adults in the audience while entertaining the kiddies . 	0
I guess I felt pretty jaded about this film before I saw it , less so now that I ' ve seen it . . . but I wasn ' t jaded because I ' m just some cynical , bitter queen : I ' m jaded partly because I see the potential for something even MORE wonderful than this film . 	0
And I hear that same longing in the word of a lot of the other queens out there who are taken as " bitter . " 	0
Conjures up some beautiful imagery . 	0
I really like the second verse . 	1
Gorgeous ! 	0
I can see that way of responding to it ; I was more aware of the differences , and a little more aware that , as painful as some of my own life was in the past , I live a much better life now . 	0
And like furr_a_bruin , I ' m ready to see films where the men lead lives a little more like the ones some of us really do get to live these days . 	0
Whereas Alan was reminded of how he felt isolated and didn ' t even realize that when he was in college in Indiana in the early 1970s , there were gay bars all over Indianapolis where he could have gone . 	0
If we take this story personally as a comment on how much the world hasn ' t changed for gay and bi men , or as a look at a common history many of us share , I think it works a lot better . 	0
Much of the progress in our world as gay and bi men has happened because men dared to keep at those kinds of dreams . 	0
I also have to say , I ' m always SO uncomfortable when gay men call each other " jaded queens " over their disagreements . 	0
I agree that it ' s not all that likely that Hollywood will want to make such films any time soon , but the fact that I have big dreams is NOT a flaw in me , or in anyone else . 	1
It just means we have dreams and needs that can ' t always get met right now . 	0

The different ways Christians handle Grace led to their splitting into hundreds of denominations . 	0
Christ ' s admonitions on divorce were really a way to prevent women from being abandoned by their husbands , and leaving families without livelihoods . 	0
If you continue to live in sin though , you haven ' t repented so you can ' t gain grace . 	0
Well you can repent of a sin , and then live in grace . 	1
And it gets more complicated of course , because some Protestants believe that salvation is through faith alone , some through faith and acts , and some still even believe in Pre-Destination , which means either you ' re on the list or your not and nothing you do in this life has a bearing on that . 	1
Protestants don ' t have that option , because they don ' t believe their preachers stand in for God , and so they don ' t have the power to absolve . 	0
If you were Catholic and gay , you could technically cohabitate and be celibate and live in grace , but if you slip up and have sex , you could go to confession and be absolved . 	0

When I looked at the vote breakdown by race , whites were slightly in disfavor , hispanics were slightly in favor , and blacks were strongly in favor of Prop 8 . 	0

Section 2 : Section 7 . 5 is added to Article I of the California Constitution to read : Section 7 . 5 Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . " 	0
The entirety of prop 8 is this : " Section 1 : Title This measure shall be known and may be sited as the " California Marriage Protection Act . " 	0
It ' s so misleading when the pro-8 people had signs that had a website called " www . protectmarriage . org . " 	1
They claimed that a yes vote would protect children in schools , promote equality , and protect marriage . 	0
Every time I saw a pro-Prop8 sign , it made me livid . 	0

No , a pregnant woman doesn ' t need a man , but she kinda does need ( or at least massively benefit from ) the time and money contributions of a second person . 	0

Assuming height-weight proportionate in both cases , which can make a difference . 	0
Plain . 	0
Looks aren ' t everything . 	1
In fact , they usually lead to an artificially inflated sense of worth for the attractive person , and attitudes which usually piss me off to no end . 	0
Plus they ' ll likely be bad at sex , having never had to put much effort into it and not the intelligence to realize how much fun it can actually be . 	0
The ' plain ' girl probably has plenty of things that make her beautiful , if one looks . 	0
And there are many measures for that . 	0
The intelligence would be a definite aphrodisiac , assuming she knew how to apply it to the situation . 	0
Then there are the girls who are pretty dang hot but seem to think they ' re plain , yet happen to be Mensa material , AND are flexible as hell and passionate to no end in bed . 	0
THOSE are the ones I look for . 	0
Their so HARSH . 	0

after watching an interview on lateline where a spokesman for the australian israeli jewish affair council explicitly said that if you question the actions of the israeli government then you are effectively anti-zionist and a card carrying member of hezzbollah . 	0
and all of this bullshit where they refuse to hold a temporary ceasefire to allow foreign national tourists to safely evactuate , as fucked up and shitty as that is , has me simply livid . 	0
what the fuck are they thinking ? 	0
i ' m so angry that i ' m shaking . 	0
i ' m so angry at them that i can ' t think straight . 	0
i bet you that they ' d fucking snap to like nervous fucking field mice in the eyes of a hungry hawk . 	0
and why the hell hasn ' t australia , or britian , or germany , or any other of america ' s allies got on the horn and said that if they don ' t force israel to hold a ceasefire then they ' ll pull of out their wonderfully conducted art of propaganda otherwise known as the war on terror ? 	1
Long time ! 	0

This particular argument has more to do with social standards . 	0
It is accepted that all people are " sinners " but Christians are supposed to repent their sins . 	0
I ' m not a Christian so I ' m not sure how " Grace " figures into this discussion . 	0
My understanding is that " grace " has to do with salvation . 	0
My argument is just that it is hypocritical to punish homosexuals for being unrepentant sinners but allow divorced people off the hook . 	0
Christ didn ' t say anything about homosexuals but he was quite explicit about divorce . 	0
The issue seems to be that giving social status in the Church to unrepentant sinners would encourage sin by setting a bad example . 	0

You don ' t really need someone to save you . 	0
But as it turns out you manage faster on your own when there ' s no one to crawl into bed with you . 	0
That is what I would say to myself : you think you have fallen to the point where he is essential to push you out of bed , you need somebody to do it and he is the only one that cares enough . 	0
They were right ; they just handled the announcement poorly . 	0
That there is even a need for that implies that people aren ' t happy with the government . 	0
The essence of the social contract is that if people aren ' t happy , the government should change--not that the government should try to gather intelligence to increase its power over them . 	0

I know you don ' t like the title of best friend , but normally that is the person you can be most honest with . 	0

I ' ll say that your inner circle of friends are prolly the only ones you should be as honest as you want with . 	0

Reading the article I ( as a Catholic ) have two theories : 1 ) Dudeman has actually gotten some proof somewhere that the Vatican has been beset by the Devil . 	0
2 ) Dudeman , at age 85 , has a gotten a touch of senile dementia that ' s affected him from investigating over 70 , 000 cases of demonic possession over his career . 	0

It ’ s a wonder these posh teens can even fit through door frames with such voluminous skirts . 	0
True to the gluttonous American , these crude confections have enough tulle to feed a third world fishing village , enough sequins to outfit an entire army of transvestites , and enough fabric to clothe all seven the Von Trap children with still a generous portion left over for their fat great aunt . 	0

I ' ll make a promise , and I 100% promise it will be fulfilled . 	0
Suggest one for me and I ' ll do it . 	0
I haven ' t done it yet , and I ' m scared . 	0
My next adventure will probably be going to Dad ' s grave . 	0
CC and I went on a walking adventure this weekend , and I ' ve been taking lots of pictures . 	0
; ) I love it ! 	0
dirty dirty dirty girl . 	0
thanks for saying i can squeeze into the line with you guys : ) and yeah people generally dont mind it seems i know ive done it in the past too , and my # is 646 303 8523 	0
It ' s amazing that something so " wild " is so close to DC . 	0
Thanks ! ! 	0
nah . 	0
i think about doing something like this occasionally . 	0
and then think it ' s really just a way of adding more inane photography to the deluge already out there . 	0
but then maybe it ' s a fantastic idea . 	0
either way . . 	0
I was off work for 2 weeks after a hernia op then a few days after going back I was like an old man . 	0
I ' ve been like that since before Christmas and all I did was coughed . 	0
they were really worried thinking I ' d done something to the hernia , now they ' ve got used to it and don ' t notice me hobbling around . 	0
actually . . . if i can make it halloween weekend , i pick salem or new orleans . 	0
otherwise , yeah , chicagOOO . 	0
Haha . 	0
Cross your fingers that it isn ' t all a dream ! 	0

He ' s everything I want in a boy ( conveniently meets almost all of my previously listed " boyfriend prerequisites " ) and a whole whack of things I didn ' t know I wanted . 	0
I ' m not entirely sure how it happened , but I somehow ended up with a boyfriend . . . the most fantastic boyfriend in the entire world , to be precise ! 	1
I ' m really happy . . . although I ' m still in denial that this all happened . . . it ' s too Hollywood , stuff like this doesn ' t happen in real life ! 	1
Antony ' s pretty , makes me laugh , and listens to better music than I do . 	0
is that one of those bad guys from digdug ? 	0
Because I ' ll have to be home by 10am the next morning so I can take the bus & train to Chicago to see MCR . 	0
Oh , heck , I need to know what time it is going to be ! 	0
Sometimes the arguments are so devoid of intelligence , or I ' ve heard them so many times before , that there ' s no reward in refuting them , but if the other side is willing to engage , then having to explain myself and not getting any free passes means that the argument gets a good workout . 	0
Is this HHGGTG ? 	0
But right now we don ' t have that . 	0
Instead , we have conservative think tanks complaining that what little aid we do give costs too much . 	0
What " choice for men " comes down to for me is who bears the cost instead . 	1
I ' m a lot more comfortable with the idea of a father being able to legally opt out if there ' s a sufficient support system in place so that the child ' s mother can raise the child without assistance from the father - even if she chooses not to . 	0
But it ' s not particularly relevant here unless one takes the attitude that child support is supposed to be either compensation for , or an equivalent " punishment " to , pregnancy , and I don ' t see how one can reconcile that attitude with feminism . 	0
And as for calling folks on things , it depends on the situation . 	0
I think the bringing up of " pregnancy is so dangerous " may simply have been a context failure . 	1
I typically see that argument used in the context of pro-choice or childfree advocacy , and he may have just internalized that as " the feminist position . " 	0
So marked . 	0
But it seems much to long to wait ! 	0
I think people are responding strongly to the story partly because of something envirobear said earlier in this thread : " The story . . . is sparse . . . that is part of its power , because it requires the reader or viewer to put his / her OWN experiences into play and feel the emotion generated from within yourself . " 	1
I think a lot of us are seeing this movie through the lens of our own experiences , and it ' s feeling intensely personal because we line the pain the characters feel up with whatever we ' ve been through that feels similar and was painful at the time . 	0
To me , it ' s the film ' s biggest strength AND greatest weakness . 	0
I got into a bit of an argument with my own partner last night , because he was telling me about how " this is the story that a lot of gay and bi men still live and struggle with , " and I was saying , " Well , yes , I ' m sure it is , but not exactly , and the differences may be important , and maybe we shouldn ' t overpersonalize this . " 	0
I mean , I actually did live in Wyoming in the late 1980s , a few years after this film ends . 	0
They also told us not to get caught at the gay bars in Denver . 	0
Which is to say , by the time I lived in Wyoming , twenty years after the characters in the film were that age , we had words like " gay " and concepts like " gay bar , " even if they were two hours away and sounded scary . 	0
I was closeted , felt isolated , and dated a couple of women . . . but even in 1985 , I was vaguely aware that there were other options . 	0
Now in 2005 , the options are even greater , even if the isolation and depression and feelings of entrapment still hit a lot of us . 	0
what ? 	0

I guess they just want to feed us the crumbs 	0

In other news , I ' m afraid that I will never meet any of the TDS or TCR people I admire . . . and if I don ' t meet them , I will never be completely happy with my life . 	0
I ' m afraid of being uncool , so I try too hard by chatting up the things I think are cool about me . 	0
On LJ and on OSCLA , I am constantly afraid that no one will like me . 	0
I end up treating this all like it is high school , but I haven ' t been in high school for a long time . 	0

Hm , that ' s interesting . 	0

In this case , polar bears , which used to be numerous in Newfoundland and Labrador , and NWT kept the seals down , but since they ' re on the extinction list . . . they haven ' t been doing alot lately . 	0
The number of seals has actually doubled since the 70s . . . and do you know how much they eat ? 	0
They would populate themselves into famine if left unchecked . 	0
I used to be against it , until I had to study the fisheries and now I get that though many animals are cute , and these are the ones I don ' t like seeing killed ( seals , deers , rabbits , kangaroos ) that sometimes it is necessary . 	1
I don ' t want to get argumentative on LJ , but why don ' t you agree with the seal hunt ? 	0
Do you agree with hunting deer ? 	0
Culling cat and dog populations by neutering ? 	0
The unfortunate truth is that we ' ve killed off many of the predators that kept seal populations in check ( like we did with deer and moose , etc ) . 	0

Oh , and she always complains to her husband about how she doesn ' t even know who she is anymore and he spends too much time at the office and is he cheating on her with his secretary . 	0

I ' m not sure I ' d sign on to the Marxist part of your definition of radical feminist . 	1
That only describes a fraction of the overall group . 	0
In Germany , single motherhood is less common than in the U . S . - people are less delusional about sex and birth control . 	0
But up until recently , anyway , going on welfare as a single mother was not terribly stigmatized . 	0
The German social safety net has been progressively undermined over the past few years , so I have to think that this option is getting harder - they have a lot more emphasis on working to earn one ' s benefits , which is obviously a problem if you have little ones . 	0
( Germany ' s public daycare system is also being slowly de-funded . ) 	0
Sunflower , you were in Canada when you had your babies , yes ? 	0
Because as jfpbookworm points out , the supports are awfully thin here in the U . S . The only reason men get stuck with child support is that society as a whole isn ' t willing to support children of single parents . 	1
At least in Canada , you ' re covered for health care . 	0

I ' m going to be shopping on my way to work at 7am tomorrow morning because I fail and forgot my office christmas gifts , and then I have to go out and buy Dirty Santa presents on Christmas Eve - oh joy : / 	0
At least with girls , all you have to do is get them something shiny or something that smells good and they will be happy : ) Those pictures of the twins with their dog just made me melt < 333 Nothing is more attractive than a guy who is not afraid to show his love for his pets : ) Good luck catching up on your Christmas stuff . 	0

WTF Are you going ? ! 	0
You can ' t really have that kind of set-up though , but a small office might get you pretty close . . . 	0
In a small office where my boss is my dad and I know the accountant pretty well , and I talk to the same fifteen subcontractors on the phone , it ' s not an overly social environment like most other jobs I ' ve had have been ( which is probably the main reason I don ' t have a rapidly developing ulcer right now ) , so I don ' t have to be that outgoing . 	0
About the job thing , I ' ve always just faked outgoing-ness . 	0
It ' s just all so out of control . 	0
I ' ve been listening to news less lately , too . 	0

Hi , friends ! 	0
( well , in a minute ) 	0
I often get frustrated at the amount of things I ' m supposed to remember during casual conversations . 	0
Dates of future events , etc . That usually leads me to feel like a heel , like I don ' t care enough to pay attention , so having those conversations afterwards where I feel like I let her down because I didn ' t remember something , that ' s frustrating . 	0

COMMENT TO BE ADDED . 	0
By your logic , the only people who can " legitimately " comment on the story / movie are bi shepherds who ' ve spent a lot of time out in the middle of nowhere with a flock . 	0
I grant you there ' s a certain amount of urban sniffery in those two perspectives on thot of truth in th my pserspective there ' s also a lot of truth in what they say that most people jibbering madly about the movie just don ' t want to deal with . 	0
I grew up in semi-rural Oregon - no , not WAY out in the middle of nowhere , but far , far from being a " big city . " 	0

Which is why I stuck mostly to calling buddy on the underlying sexism in how he was participating - refutation of his arguments just didn ' t seem to have enough of a constructive return , either for the debate as it was shaping before he came along , or for me . 	0
But , yeah , I don ' t call everybody on everything - life ' s too short . 	0

What I take offense at is the suggestion there ' s something wrong with me for disliking the story ( and presumably by extension , the movie . ) 	0
Note that I ' m talking about the response to my opinion of this particular work in the aggregate , not necessarily or specifically yours . 	0
Whether or not the word " love " gets used or not , clearly there ' s supposedly passion in the story . . . but what does it do ? 	0
I take offense at the insinuation that I ' m some kind of traitor to the " Gay Cause " for thinking the story sucks and that the hype around the movie is simply INTOLERABLE . 	1
Passion moves fucking mountains and surmounts daunting difficulties . 	0
It ' s like getting a huge verbal buildup for a fireworks display that turns out to be a guy waving a couple of sparklers . 	0

I ' ve just been tussling with that particularly poisonous variety of " feminist ally " , a Knight in Shining Armor . 	0
I ' d like to say I took him apart , but , while I believe I acquitted myself very well , I fear he missed the point altogether , and flounced with his complacence and his virtuously noble self-image unscathed . 	0
When I deal with them , I sound for all the world like a stereotypical grim-and-strident radical feminist - out come phrases like " sexist entitlement " and " male privilege " . 	0
Nope , I ' m definitely not a Fun Feminist when it comes to that . 	0
A Knight in Shining Armor is the sort of male self-described feminist ( or he may describe himself as a feminist ally , or some other term chosen to show that of course he ' d never usurp our movement - this one favors " radical pro-feminist " ) who is involved with feminism because he ' s Good and Noble , and will slay all the evil misogynistic patriarchal villains and make the world safe for womankind . 	0

The core of where I was going definitionally was the difference in approach - from my reading thus far , the question , " by what means can we best achieve our goals ? " seems to be the main way in which " schools " of feminism split off from each other ( first-wave example : the suffragists and those who focused on equality in educational opportunities [ educationalists ? ? ] ) 	0
I don ' t consider " Marxist " to be part of the definition , nor even " collectivist-socialist " - that bit was more a reflection on how , and in what part of the zeitgeist of the times , radical feminism did much of its developing . 	0
Yup , I ' ve been talking about the " different jurisdictions , different conditions " thing all along ( and was pleased to read your German example - I know very little about how it works in countries other than Canada and the US ) . 	1

Sir Knigget is not without utility ; he not only contributed greatly to clarifying my thinking regarding that discussion , he also shed some light on the complex tangle of my feminism . 	1
- Sunflower If I ' m reading my feminist history aright , that ' s right on the historic fracture point between liberal feminism and radical feminism ; liberal feminism preferred to address injustices by adjusting the existing paradigms , while radical feminism believed it was necessary to examine , and work to change , the paradigm itself . 	1
Obliging men to ante up does nothing whatsoever to address those injustices ; it seeks only to alleviate them . " 	0
Old-school radical feminism , or so I understand , largely examined paradigms through collectivist-socialist , or even outright Marxist , lenses , while I ' m cut [ changes metaphors in midstream ] from rather different cloth ( though the fabric still has a left bias - " individualist-socialist " might describe it ) . 	0
( I invite corrections , clarifications , etc , from my more learned readers . ) 	0
( Certainly I have a good many ideas that some feminists , many of whom identify as radfem , consider " radical " in the pejorative sense , but that ' s another can of worms . ) 	0
